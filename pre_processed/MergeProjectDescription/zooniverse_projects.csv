1;Catalina Outer Solar System Survey;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/fulsdavid/catalina-outer-solar-system-survey/about/research;"Welcome to the outer solar system!
Here, you will be looking through archival data from the Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) in an attempt to discover new Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs).
CSS is relentless when it comes to scanning the night sky for asteroids that come close to our planet. From the mountain peaks of southern Arizona, CSS operates almost every clear night making real time discoveries, and has been doing this since 1998.
CSS can find dozens of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) in a single night by looking for objects that move within a sequence of images taken over several minutes. However, NEOs are much closer than TNOs, and therefore in these images TNOs do not appear to move at all. The timescale of minutes is far too short to detect any motion from these distant worlds.
However, using the same night-time field images acquired over several months enables us to detect the motion of TNOs!
Why are we using CSS images to search for TNOs? Unlike other surveys for TNOs and other distant objects, CSS covers more than half of the total sky instead of only small bands near the ecliptic. This wider view is where unknown objects with larger orbital inclinations and other oddities can be found.
How can I find a TNO?
Want to know what it takes to explore the farthest reaches of our solar system? Lots of work goes into the process, but the final step is up to you! Let's walk through the process of finding a TNO to see exactly where you fit in. Below are two images taken from one of the CSS telescopes of the same place in the sky about a month apart.
Can you see two tiny green circles? Don't worry if you can't. Lots of computer processing went in to identifying an object that isn't in the same place in the two images. That would be almost impossible for a human. Lets zoom in below for a closer look.
You can probably now see the two green circles. There are also two yellow circles to show where the object is in the other image. This helps us see more clearly that the object has moved. This is a great start! But if we just look at two images, we tend to find lots and lots of false detections. To help with that, we look at four images. The likelihood of four random smudges, cosmic rays, or image artifacts lining up perfectly across months of time is much less than for two images. However, four images this big is still a LOT of cosmic real estate to look at! To help out, astronomers like to animate the images. That way, real objects look like they are moving. Below is an animation of the first two images plus two more. They were all taken about a month apart from each other.
This is STILL a lot to take in. Especially if the object we are interested in has moved even further than this one. Then we would be zoomed so far out to see the whole path the moving object that we wouldn't be able to see the object, it would be too tiny in the images. Most of this image is excess space, made up of the large gaps between the objects positions. We really only care about the small space where the object would appear from image to image. So we have cut out small squares of the images, and put them right next to each other. This is what it looks like:
This is where you come in! We need you to sort through these animated images, and help us identify which ones have REAL objects like the one above! Now this is an example with a very BRIGHT and well known TNO named Makemake. Most of the new ones we detect will be much fainter. When you are ready click the Classify tab to start. A tutorial will start automatically for your first time. Once you are in the Classify tab, you can always review the tutorial by clicking the tutorial tab."
2;Boston Phoenix, 1974!;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/gmecagni/boston-phoenix-1974/about/research;"The Boston Phoenix
For nearly 50 years, The Boston Phoenix was Boston’s alternative newspaper of record, the first word on social justice, politics, and the arts and music scene. Its intrepid journalists tackled issues from safe sex and AIDS awareness to gay rights, marriage equality, and the legalization of marijuana. Ads for roommates, romantic mates, and band mates—one could find all these and more in the newspaper’s probing, irreverent, entertaining pages.
It ceased publication in March 2013, but in 2015 was preserved for posterity thanks to owner Stephen Mindich’s decision in September to donate the paper’s archives to Northeastern University's Archives and Special Collections.
Research
For any researcher visiting the Northeastern University Archives and Special Collections to research Boston’s political, cultural, and social history between the 1970’s through the early 2000’s, The Boston Phoenix is always recommended as a primary resource, and is widely used both for direct research and as a pedagogical tool.
Although there is a robust description and links to descriptions of the content acquired as part of the Phoenix collection on its portal page, https://phoenix.library.northeastern.edu/home/, there are currently very few direct entry points into the collection. Either a researcher needs to have a reference to a specific article (including a date); the only other option is to browse the bound volumes.
However, the Phoenix did produce two typed card file indices to its paper, which allowed reporters to find similar articles from years past that could help them with their writing. One index is a subject index, the other is an author index. These indices have been scanned, OCRed and made available online here:
Author Indexes, 1973- 1990
Index Subjects, 1974-1986, (bulk 1974-1982)
Filed by year, each author and subject index usually consists of >1000 cards, and includes multiple entry points including date, page, section, title, author, section, and subject.
Additionally, January-June 1974 of The Boston Phoenix had been disbound and digitized for preservation purposes. (It was too fragile for public use). These issues have been made available in the DRS. So if your article is within these date ranges, you can read the article you just indexed! https://repository.library.northeastern.edu/collections/neu:cj82m7888
Goals
The primary goal of the Boston Phoenix 1974! project is to build a community of support for Phoenix publications by asking volunteers to take a deep dive into the arts, culture, politics, and topics of Boston in 1974. This community will hopefully be inspired to read articles they have transcribed and write about them on their favorite social media platform.
The secondary goal is to make the project available for educational purposes. Several faculty members have reached out looking for hands-on projects that could keep their students engaged while studying from home and/or fulfilling experiential education requirements. Educators have successfully used Zooniverse in many different curricular settings; several of these could be modified for Phoenix work. https://blog.zooniverse.org/category/education/
A completed index could also become a prime source for other digital humanities projects, tracking trends in politics, the arts, or news through time. How did so-called 'fringe' causes, such as LGBTQA rights, marijuana decriminalization, and alternative energy become mainstream? What issues in 1974 were at the forefront of the arts and politics sections of the Phoenix?
The tertiary goal of the project is to make a fielded dataset from the 1974 cards, starting with the author index (~1500 cards). If successful, the project could also be expanded to include the 1974 subject file, and to subsequent years. It will be some time before researchers have broad, searchable access to a scanned Phoenix collection that has been OCRed, and still some more time before an accurate article subject index could be created via METS/ALTO or another standard that the library might adopt in the future."
3;Iguanas from Above;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/andreavarela89/iguanas-from-above/about/research;"About Marine Iguanas
The marine iguana (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) is a charismatic and endemic species of the Galápagos Islands that is threatened with extinction. The species consists of 11 subspecies, each of which is unique and important for the survival of the species as a whole. Since the marine iguana is endemic, it is not found anywhere else on earth (not even in zoos!). If it is lost from the Galápagos Islands, then it is lost forever.
Marine Iguanas are the world’s only sea-going lizard, they have amazing adaptations like absorbing their own bone matter to survive hard times, and they inspired the creation of Godzilla. However, marine iguanas face a complex combination of threats due to human activities. These threats include predation by introduced animals like cats, rats, and dogs; marine pollution from oil spills and other sources and climate change.
Conservation authorities want to help, but the problem is that marine iguana colonies are very hard to reach, and so we have never been able to collect good estimates of how many marine iguanas are left and where exactly they can be found. Without this information, effectively conserving them is very difficult (if not impossible!), and we might be losing important populations or even whole subspecies without realizing it.
About the project
By using drones to survey the marine iguana populations, we can collect high quality images from which iguanas can be counted at a later stage. This means we survey much faster and don’t need to physically visit all the colonies. And because we can send the drones from boats, we can do this work with minimal disturbance to the delicate wildlife of the islands.
Through this work, we collect a huge number of images, and it would take our small team a long time to do all the counting. This is why we are asking for your help through our project on Zooniverse. By joining in, you are making an incredibly valuable contribution to preserving the unique wildlife of the Galapagos Islands. We are confident that our Zooniverse project will give us reliable estimates of marine iguana population sizes, but to prove it we will compare these counts with those from ground-based surveys; this will ensure that our work is scientifically rigorous. In addition, you can help us collect data on other species and interesting finds on the islands, and these results will be shared with other conservationists and scientists so that many endangered species can be helped.
Right now we are processing the data from our pilot stage, where we focussed on two islands (San Cristobal and Santa Fe), but we hope to survey the rest of the Islands within the next year so that we will soon have a complete record of the size and location of all key marine iguana populations. This information will be a huge step forward in marine iguana conservation and will really help us to protect these amazing animals from extinction in a rapidly changing world.
Our main aims are to:
*Develop a safe and non-invasive surveying technique alongside a volunteer-based method for quick counting
*Publish the first reliable estimates of the size and location of three highly endangered subspecies
*Create the first species survival plan for the marine iguana to guide their effective protection

5;Embryo Cam;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/embryophenomics/embryo-cam/about/research;"CAPTURING THE MOST DYNAMIC PROCESS OF AN ORGANISM'S LIFE HISTORY
Embryonic development is the most dynamic period of an organisms' life history and has long been a period of fascination to researchers. Embryos change on a minute by minute, hour by hour and day by day basis and trying to capture this dynamic process presents a formidable challenge to scientists.
Our Research group works at the University of Plymouth where we have developed new automated technologies for recording large numbers of aquatic embryos for the duration of their embryonic development and this enables us to capture and study the fundamental process of biological development in an unprecedented way.
Our microscopes generate huge volumes of video data, the next step is to analyse it. Manual analysis is inefficient and so to analyse video efficiently we are turning to artificial intelligence (AI). We are using AI to train the computer to autonomously spot features in developing embryos. For this, we need you! By drawing around features of interest and identifying when the embryo is performing certain behaviours you will provide the computer with ""training data"" so it can learn from you!
This is an important mission because we know that early life stages are sensitive to their environments, but not how sensitive or what they are most sensitive to. We need this understanding as the environment is changing at an unprecedented rate. Therefore, we urgently need your help to generate these data!
OUR TECHNOLOGY
What is EmbryoPhenomics?
EmbryoPhenomics is a technological platform for the autonomous video recording of developing aquatic embryos comprised of a video microscope we call OpenVIM and software called EmbryoCV (computer vision).

Here are three OpenVIM systems in our laboratory
What does it do?
This technology enables us to record and monitor embryos developing under a range of experimental conditions, such as different temperatures that reflect climate change scenarios. Analysing how development is effected by changes in environment, such as changes in temperature, will help scientists understand how climate change may effect animals developing in aquatic environments.

Timelapse video of two snail embryos developing under different environmental temperatures
Why do we need your help?
Your contribution will enable us to extend these technologies to address some of the most pressing challenges of understanding how early life stages are responding to our current environmental crisis. Furthermore, these new technologies are going to be deployed both in the laboratory and out in the environment. Your data will allow us to build intelligent devices that measure what embryos are doing out in their environment! So, please help us train the next generation of technologies for helping to understand our impact on biodiversity!
What are our research goals?
The EmbryoPhenomics research group is establishing new technologies and approaches to research in marine biology and applying these to some of the most pressing research challenges of our time. Our goal is to drive forward the limits of what is currently possible in research on developmental ecophysiology and to use these new approaches to understand how early life stages are responding in a changing world.

6;A Century of Natural History Observations;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/mohonkpreservedsrc/a-century-of-natural-history-observations/about/research;The Natural History Observation Card File consists of 14,000 3x5 notecards containing extensive natural history observations of the flora and fauna of the Shawangunk Ridge recorded by Daniel Smiley (1907-1989) – prominent regional naturalist and Mohonk Preserve co-founder – and other research associates. The card file, together with the Preserve’s other natural history collections and weather/phenological data, are valuable for research because of their long-term consistency, providing a record of changes in the natural world over many decades. Each index card contains information similar to a museum specimen label (i.e. date, location, observer’s name, taxonomy), and other pertinent information such as weather, behavior (for animals), phenological information, and historical context. Because these data are so extensive and have been consistently collected over so many years, they create a unique data source for scientists to conduct a range of projects. For instance, our extensive phenological records help demonstrate how climate change is affecting the natural cycles of nature. Is spring coming earlier as the months get warmer? Are animals disappearing from the landscape and invasives taking over? Digitizing this collection will help us to support new research on a variety of scientific topics. Once this project is completed, the data will be available for access on the Environmental Data Initiative platform.
7;AI4Mars;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/hiro-ono/ai4mars/about/research;"Our Motivation
Terrain is important to get around on Mars. Spirit got stuck in a sand pit and ended its mission after 7 years of exploring Mars (but far exceeding its nominal mission length of 90-days). Opportunity and Curiosity also have experienced getting stuck in sand, although they were able to continue on their missions. Don’t you think it would be nice if the Mars rover could identify dangerous terrain by herself? That is what a team at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory is working on using Machine learning – essentially the same technology used by self-driving cars on Earth. To do so, the rover needs training data to learn from.
The Problem
On Earth, researchers across the globe have managed to curate many different datasets for things we encounter in day-to-day life, such as house numbers, cityscapes, random stuff, and maybe most importantly, puppies and kittens!
Sadly, all of this data is of little use for mission critical, autonomous exploration of other celestial bodies...
Our Goal
We're counting on citizen scientists' help in labeling a set of images captured by Mars rovers so that we collectively create the Solar System's first public benchmark for Martian terrain classification. Uncrewed space exploration will depend on the rover knowing where it's safe to drive, land, sleep and hibernate; this project is an early step in that direction.
The Dream
With this dataset, we (that includes YOU) will be able to start work on new machine learning approaches for exploring Mars.

8;Disk Detective;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/ssilverberg/disk-detective/about/research;"Planets form from vast clouds of gas, dust, and chunks of rock---clouds in the shape of disks, with stars in the center. We can find out where planets are forming and where planets probably remain today by searching for stars that are surrounded by these disks. Finding these disks, called “debris disks” or “YSO disks” depending on their age and gas content, has been a major quest of astronomers for the last three decades.
NASA’s WISE mission observed more than two billion sources, including galaxies, stars, nebulae, and asteroids--not to mention image artifacts and noise. Among these two billion sources are thousands of new disks waiting to be discovered.
Here at Disk Detective, you will help astronomers find these disks, homes for extrasolar planets. You'll examine images of disk candidates from NASA's WISE mission, and compare them with images of from four different astronomical surveys: the SkyMapper Southern Sky Survey, the Pan-STARRS survey, the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), and the unWISE coadds of data from the WISE mission. Many of them will be junk, but every now and then you'll find a nice clean image, with no background objects or noise overwhelming the signal. And some of those will be new circumstellar disks!
This new version of the project is Disk Detective 2.0. It's a sequel to a citizen science project launched back in 2014 on the original Zooniverse Ouroboros platform. Disk Detective 1.0 discovered a whole new class of disks, called ""Peter Pan Disks"". Check out some more results from Disk Detective 1.0 here!
What are these ""disks"" we're trying to find?
A circumstellar disk is what it sounds like--it's a belt of material around a star. We typically expect debris disks to appear around main-sequence stars--stars that are in the main part of their life burning hydrogen. These are mostly made up of dust leftover from collisions of planetesimals--rocky bodies that might have eventually formed planets.
We also see disks around stars in their pre-main-sequence period--in the time when stars are actually forming. These disks are variously called Young Stellar Object (YSO) disks because they orbit pre-main sequence stars, or primordial disks because they are made up of material from the cloud that formed the star. These systems are very gas-rich. Some of these systems are known as protoplanetary disks, because they are the disks from which planets form!
To find these disks, we look for infrared excess--stars that have more infrared light than you would expect, which indicates the presence of material the gas and dust has warmed up. Here, we have selected a set of systems that have infrared excess--we are looking for your help to make sure that these systems actually look the way we expect them to (rather than looking like galaxies, or material from the gas and dust between stars).
Why use citizen science for this?
The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) surveyed the full sky in four wavelengths of infrared light, allowing it to discover tens of thousands of circumstellar disks...in and among the other billion sources it found. However, WISE images can confuse a disk-hosting star with a galaxy, or nebulosity between the stars. The most effective way to detect these differences is by visual inspection of objects in multiple wavelengths, including optical and near-infrared light. To evaluate multiple thousands of objects efficiently, we've asked citizen scientists like YOU to help us out!
What happens next?
Once you all decide that an object is a good candidate, the science team springs into action! With your helpful comments on Talk, we investigate the good candidates in astronomical catalogs to weed out certain kinds of false positive that don't show up in our classification data. Then we collect follow-up observations to learn more! The best candidates after this advanced vetting and follow-up become new disk candidates in published professional journal articles!

Travel back to the docks of Daytona Beach, Florida from the 1940's through 70's through the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council's (SAFMC) pilot project FISHstory. This project will train citizen science volunteers to identify and count fish in historic fishing photos. Data collected with your help will provide a novel picture of the fishery prior to dedicated monitoring programs and help improve our understanding of the fishery for several iconic species.
Species composition and length data can be critical to accurately estimate stock productivity and there is very little information from 1940 to 1970 when for-hire fisheries off the Atlantic coast of Florida were gaining popularity. As a result, it’s critical that we fill these data gaps to help evaluate assumptions about stock productivity. Historic photos, untapped sources of this important biological data, can help do just that. Analyzing the photos will help provide better information of what people were catching during this time period, seasonality of their catches, and possibly estimate a rough catch per angler which can provide insights on the health of fish populations.
How FISHstory Got Started
Rusty Hudson, a fisherman out of Daytona Beach, Florida has been involved in South Atlantic U.S. fisheries for many years. He approached fisheries scientists in the region about the large photo archive he had from his family’s fishing fleet in the 1940s-1970s. Rusty saw the value in what these photos could provide - helping document historic catches before dedicated catch monitoring programs began. Working collaboratively with Rusty and scientists in the region, Council staff hatched the idea for the FISHstory project.
So what are you looking at?
Each photo represents a single fishing trip. Groups of passengers would pay to be taken out on one of the vessels within the fleet. These vessels were designed to provide passengers with a comfortable space to fish while the captain and crew made sure they enjoyed their time on the water. The captain and crew would select different fishing locations depending on the weather, time of year, and other factors. When the vessel returned to the dock they would unload the day's catch. These photos were taken to commemorate the customer's day on the water. The photos were retained at the docks for promotional use and the customers could buy a copy for their photo albums. Today the Critter fleet is the last remaining charter service that can be seen within the FISHstory photos, however modern charter services still take advantage of these lucrative fishing grounds.
Validation Process
Because fish identification can be challenging, we have a team of fish ID experts, comprised of both scientists and fishermen, who will help review photos when there isn't agreement of the types of fish found in a photo. To learn more about this process or to request to be part of the Validation Team, drop us a line in the ""Talk"" section.
About The South Atlantic Fishery Management Council
The South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC) is headquartered in Charleston, South Carolina and is responsible for managing fisheries in federal waters from the North Carolina/Virginia border to the Florida Keys. Federal waters refers to waters 3 to 200 miles offshore. The council is made up of 13 voting members including representatives from the commercial and recreational fishing sectors along with representatives from each state in the region. We manage 70 different species and have 7 different fisheries management plans. To learn more about SAFMC or to get involved, please visit our website: safmc.net
SAFMC Citizen Science Program
The Council's Citizen Science Program was developed over the course of three years with the guidance of a wide array of stakeholders and partners. The aim was to build a program that would engage fishermen, scientists, and managers in co-creating citizen science projects that would align with the Council's research needs. The projects would collect new data to supplement existing data collection programs and be used to develop fisheries management strategies and considered for use in stock assessments. To learn more about SAFMC's citizen science program visit our website: SAFMC Citizen Science
FISHstory Project Location
FISHstory includes photos of fishing trips departing from Inlet Harbor and Timmons Fish Camp in Daytona Beach, Florida. These locations were family run operations with multiple vessels. Today fishing charter trips still leave out of Inlet Harbor, while Timmons Fish Camp has since become a seafood restaurant.
Fishing locations varied depending on the vessel, season, weather, or even day. Because of this the depth of water fished and, subsequently, the species caught vary. The maps below show some of the typical fishing locations.

Meet The Captains and Vessels
FISHstory involves not just fish, but people as well! Our photos show fishing and family history. The men and women shown in the FISHstory photos were born and raised on the water and their passion for fishing shows.
Rusty Hudson

Russell Howard Hudson, aka Rusty, was born in 1955 in Greenville, SC. His fishing career started at an early age. By age 4, Rusty was fishing with his family at Timmons Fish Camp in Ponce Park, FL. Because he was a child in a US Air Force family, he spent over three years in Japan.
By 1964 Rusty had returned to FL and was working aboard both the Mako and the Broadbill with Captain Jake Stone, his grandfather, and Captain Bob Stone, his uncle. Rusty also worked aboard The Flamingo, another one of Jake Stone’s vessels, and worked within the commercial fishing and shrimping sector with other captains in the Inlet Harbor fleet.
Rusty has provided FISHstory with not only the historic photos documenting his family’s trips on the water, but a wealth of knowledge on identifying fish, information on the state of fisheries at the time, regional fish names, and FISHstory design input. Without him FISHstory would not be possible.

The Allies liberated the concentration camps 75 years ago. This year, the corona pandemic has made it impossible for people to come together at memorial sites to remember the many millions of victims who were imprisoned, exploited, and murdered there by the National Socialists under inhumane conditions. The “Every Name Counts” project provides a simple way for anyone to take part in active remembrance without leaving the house.
Objective of the project
Our goal is to ensure that all the names in the millions of documents stored in the Arolsen Archives can be found in the online archive – so that people all over the world can easily access information on the fate of their relatives.
The Arolsen Archives - Who we are
The Arolsen Archives are an international center on Nazi persecution with the world’s most comprehensive archive on the victims and survivors of National Socialism. The collection has information on about 17.5 million people and belongs to UNESCO’s Memory of the World. It contains documents on the various victim groups targeted by the Nazi regime and is an important source of knowledge for society today.
What we do
The Arolsen Archives are committed to preserving their unique collection of documents on Nazi persecution and to making them accessible worldwide. We search for the traces of victims and survivors of the National Socialist terror regime and, even today, we are still helping to reunite families torn apart by the Holocaust, the persecution of minorities, and forced labor.
In 1998, staff started to digitize the documents in Bad Arolsen. Today, 85 to 90 percent of the holdings have already been scanned. These documents should be accessible to as many people as possible. This is why the Arolsen Archives are publishing more and more of their holdings in their Online Archive.
The Challenge: to create a digital record of all the names and all the information
Many millions of names are already searchable in our Online Archive. However, the name search can only be successful if the documents have been digitized and saved together with the names they contain (i.e. if so-called metadata have been created). This data is currently missing for a large number of lists in the online archive. This means that hundreds of thousands of names that are on lists cannot be found in the online archive. However, it takes a long time to record this information and, considering the millions of documents involved, it really is a huge task.
This is why we need your help!"

12;Spiral Graph;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/astro-lab-ncmns/spiral-graph/about/research;"Help us map out spiral arms in galaxies
The ability of the human brain find and process patterns is far superior to any computer. Spiral patterns in disk galaxies are easily seen and followed by people but computer algorithms have a harder time determining where spirals begin and end, especially if they aren't continuous. That's where you come in! By tracing the spiral arms you see in galaxy images, you are giving our computer algorithm a boost so it can accurately measure how tightly wrapped the structure is. The degree of wrapping of the spiral arms is called the pitch angle[1]. If a spiral pattern has very tightly wrapped arms, it has a small pitch angle. If it the spiral pattern is very open, it has a large pitch angle.
[2]
Why is measuring pitch angle important?
The pitch angle of spiral arms relates to other parameters of the host galaxy that are more difficult and time consuming to measure. These parameters include the mass of the black hole found in the nucleus[3], bulge stellar mass[4], galaxy total stellar mass[5], maximum rotational velocity, and dark matter content of the galaxy[6]. By measuring the spiral arm pitch angle we can quickly and easily estimate these parameters and identify interesting galaxies for more detailed, follow-up telescope observations.
For example, we can use pitch angles to search for black holes in the centers of galaxies with masses that range from hundreds to hundreds of thousands of times the mass of our Sun (intermediate mass black holes). Most galaxies have central black holes with masses that range from millions to billions of times the mass of our Sun (supermassive black holes). So far, less than a half-dozen intermediate mass black hole candidates have been found and scientists are looking for more galaxies that host these rare objects in order to better understand their evolution.
The Method
The method to measure spiral arm pitch angle has two main steps: (1) deprojecting the galaxy and (2) tracing the spiral arms.
1. Deprojection
Spiral galaxies are observed at various inclinations relative to our line of sight. Below are photographs of a 3D printed model spiral galaxy taken at different angles to illustrate the point.
Nearly edge-on Moderately inclined Nearly face-on
In order to accurately measure the spiral arm pitch angle of a galaxy, we first need to approximate what it looks like when viewed face-on. The first task is to ""deproject"" a galaxy to a face-on view. This is done by fitting an ellipse to the outer visible edges of the galaxy[7] and then stretching along the short axis of the ellipse until it becomes a circle. This is illustrated below with our model.
Inclined galaxy Fit an ellipse to the galaxy Rotate the ellipse Stretch the ellipse to a circle
2. Tracing
Once a galaxy has been deprojected, the arms are now ready to be traced. The traced arms tell us how many visible arms the galaxy has and gives us a model of where the arms visibly begin and end in the image. This is illustrated below.
Deprojected galaxy One arm traced All arms traced Model of galaxy arms
The model created by you will then be plugged into a computer algorithm called P2DFFT[8] and the pitch angle will be calculated. If a galaxy is found to have a pitch angle in the range expected for an intermediate mass black hole, it will be flagged for further analysis and possible future telescope observations!
3. Real Images
The actual galaxy images in this project come from data release 5 of the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) and are in the g-band. When a DECaLS image of the galaxy is not suitable or available, we then use images from data release 14 (DR14) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The real images won't be as clear and crisp as the images of the 3D printed model, but that's precisely why we need your eyes to help us.

13;Aurora Zoo;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/dwhiter/aurora-zoo/about/research;"How does nature create such a beautiful show?
The aurora borealis, or northern lights, is a natural light show that forms in a ring around the Earth's north pole (the aurora australis forms around the south pole). Aurora comes from the collisions of charged particles from space colliding with the gas particles in the Earth's atmosphere.
The University of Southampton operates a camera system called ASK (Auroral Structure and Kinetics, see Dahlgren et al. 2008) for studying the aurora. ASK has telescopes to look at just a small part of the sky in detail, so we can see the smallest shapes in the aurora. Its detectors are very sensitive so that we can use short exposure times and see fast movements. ASK has been operating on Svalbard, in the high Arctic, since 2007, and automatically takes data whenever it is dark. We now have thousands of hours of video of the aurora, most of which has never been looked at. So far we've just done “event studies”, where we have investigated specific auroral events in detail, but we want to be able to do statistical studies on the ASK data – that's where Aurora Zoo comes in!

ASK is located at the EISCAT Svalbard Radar. Photo: Dan Whiter.
What is the aim of the project?
There are two main science aims of Aurora Zoo:
Understand how different small-scale shapes and movements in the aurora are formed.
Learn what conditions are needed for those different shapes and movements to happen.
We'll achieve those aims through Aurora Zoo by using the huge number of classifications to do bigger statistical studies than have ever been done before. We're sure that citizen scientists will also find exciting and unusual events to study in more detail – things nobody has ever seen before.
Why does this research matter?
A large but highly variable amount of energy enters the atmosphere from space through auroral processes, with a power approximately equal to the power consumption of the UK. That energy mainly ends up as heat, produced by electric currents associated with the aurora and by friction between ions (charged atoms and molecules) and the neutral atmosphere. We don't yet have a good understanding how the energy is transferred from space into the atmosphere, and it's difficult to predict or even measure how much heating there will be, where it will be, and how much it is focused or spread out over an area. These are important questions because the energy from aurora needs to be included in atmospheric and climate models. The small-scale shapes and movements in the aurora are a window on the physics of the energy transfer processes present, so understanding how they are formed is an important step towards understanding the energy flow into the atmosphere.
Studying aurora may also help us to predict and prepare for natural disasters such as geomagnetic storms. These storms are powerful enough to cause satellites to malfunction and electrical power-grids to fail, destroying our global power and communication systems. In 1989, a large storm caused a 9-hour blackout in Quebec, Canada. Immediately before the disruption to power, scientists observed particularly bright aurora which could have served as a warning for the upcoming disaster. Studying aurora helps us to understand the different ways space weather can affect life here on Earth.
More generally, understanding the aurora could help in a wide range of science fields. The upper atmosphere and near-Earth space, where the aurora is located and formed, is in a state of matter called plasma. 99% of the observable universe is thought to be plasma, and plasma also occurs in things like fusion reactors and lightning, so it's important for us to learn as much as we can about it. Although it is possible to create plasma artificially in a lab, studying aurora gives scientists a natural laboratory unlike any other!
How can I contribute to Aurora Zoo?
In Aurora Zoo you will see short video clips recorded by the ASK instrument, and we ask you to tell us what shape the aurora has, what movement there is, and how fuzzy (or diffuse) the aurora is. The clips are about 1s long, but you can slow them down and look at them frame by frame if you like. To start classifying aurora just press “Classify” at the top right of this page. There is a short tutorial you should see the first time you go to the classify page which we recommend you read carefully, and you can see examples of the different types of aurora in the “Field Guide” (tab on the right edge of the screen). You might also want to have a look at the FAQ page.
How is the aurora formed?
The light of the aurora has its origins in the Sun through a sequence of processes that are generally understood; however there are many unknowns in this complex system. The Sun ejects huge numbers of charged particles into space, collectively called 'plasma', which make up the solar wind. This outflowing solar wind plasma is always there, but there are big changes in its density and speed. These changes can eventually be seen as variations in auroral activity on Earth, so the Sun and its solar wind provide a source of energy to the Earth’s upper atmosphere which is incredibly variable. However, the aurora is always present somewhere in the Earth’s high latitudes.
The way that the energy is transferred from the solar wind to the Earth is complex and involves interactions between the magnetic field of the Sun, which is carried along by the solar wind, and the magnetic field of the Earth. The latter is contained in a region called the magnetosphere.

Earth's Magnetosphere. Credit: NASA/Goddard/Aaron Kasse (https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/multimedia/magnetosphere.html).
When the solar wind reaches the Earth's magnetic field, it slows down abruptly, causing a shockwave called the bow shock. Depending on the direction of the magnetic fields where they come close together, a process called 'magnetic reconnection' can occur, which allows plasma from the solar wind to enter the magnetosphere. These particles (mainly electrons but also protons), as well as others which have escaped from Earth's atmosphere, are the eventual source of the aurora. The particles are constrained to move in spirals along the Earth’s magnetic field lines, and gain hugely in energy before they descend and collide with the atoms and molecules of the upper atmosphere. The transfer of energy to these particles is the key unknown, and is very dependent on the activity of the Sun and the subsequent influence of the solar wind. The shape of Earth's magnetic field means the particles are funnelled down into the polar regions, creating an oval of aurora around each pole. When the electrons and protons enter the atmosphere we say they are 'precipitating'.
The precipitating electrons and protons hit the atoms and molecules in the air, causing them to lose electrons through a process called ionisation. These secondary electrons then go on to collide with other atoms and molecules, creating further ionisation but also giving those atoms and molecules a bit of extra energy (called 'exciting' them). When the excited atoms and molecules relax to lower energy levels they emit the extra energy as light – the aurora. The colour of light released depends on the type of atom or molecule that it came from. A viewer on the ground would see mostly green and red from atomic oxygen, but also a different red from molecular nitrogen on the lower border of the aurora. This is quite similar to the process occurring in lightning, but the colour is different because the atmospheric pressure and composition are different at the high altitudes where the aurora is formed. The precipitating electrons are charged and carry an electric current, just like the electric current flowing in lightning, but the aurora is about 20-100 times higher than a cloud producing a lightning flash.
Shapes and movement in the aurora
On a large scale, the Aurora is usually made up of arcs, sometimes called bands. An arc is like a line of aurora which stretches across the sky, usually in an east-west direction.

An auroral arc over river Kitinen, Sodankylä, Finland. Photo: Dan Whiter.
Arcs can look “quiet” without much internal structure or movement, but they can also be highly dynamic with rays, curls and folds along their length. Rays are lines which trace out the Earth's magnetic field lines, and can make an arc look like a curtain hanging in the air. Each ray is actually a small curl or fold in the arc, making it thicker and therefore more bright at that point. The rays can move rapidly along the arc in spectacular, dynamic displays.

A rayed auroral arc. Photo: Dan Whiter.
When an arc (or several arcs) are almost directly overhead, the rays inside the arcs all seem to point at the same spot in the sky, so it is like looking through a tunnel of aurora. When this happens it is called a corona, often producing an amazing sight. The aurora in a corona isn't really different from other rayed aurora – the difference is where you are viewing it from.

Looking straight up at a corona. Photo: Dan Whiter.

More crazy aurora viewed from below. Photo: Dan Whiter.
Auroral arcs typically drift southwards (in the northern hemisphere) across the sky, before either fading or moving northwards again, or if an event called a magnetospheric substorm occurs then they can explode poleward so that the aurora fills the sky. Svalbard is so far north that on the nightside of the planet the aurora usually appears on the southern horizon first and moves northward, before retreating back to the South. From Svalbard ASK can also see aurora on the dayside of the planet, where arcs are often less clear and we see what look like isolated rays and patches of aurora.
The ASK instrument looks straight up along the Earth's magnetic field through telescopes, so it can see the detail of the curls, folds, and other shapes inside an arc or patch in high resolution. Looking at the aurora on these small scales reveals a wide variety of shapes and movements which you can't normally see with your eyes. It is difficult to define a simple classification scheme for all of these features, but with the help of citizen scientists we have come up with a scheme which we think will cover most of what you can see in Aurora Zoo. For details of the shapes and movements in the Aurora Zoo classification scheme please see the Field Guide (tab on the right of screen).
Colours of the aurora
The pictures in Aurora Zoo are actually false colour (more information below). When you see the aurora with your eyes it usually looks green or red. Sometimes it has other colours, like purple and white, but that's usually because you are seeing a mix of colours or because the aurora is too faint for your eyes to determine the colour. The green and red you see are very specific colours (specific wavelengths), but actually there are many other (usually fainter) colours in the aurora, all mixed together.
The bright green comes from atomic oxygen (O), and has a wavelength of 557.7 nm. This emission has a “lifetime” of about 1 second, which means that on average it takes about 1 second for the light to be produced after the oxygen is excited (i.e. absorbs some energy). Most red colour you see is also from atomic oxygen, with a wavelength of 630 nm. This red emission has a much longer lifetime of about 2 minutes. Below about 200 km altitude the excited oxygen collides with other atoms and molecules in the atmosphere before it has time to produce the red light, whereas higher up the air is so thin that collisions between atoms are very rare. So you can only see the red light coming from very high up, about 200-500 km above the ground, above the brightest green light which comes from about 100-150 km.

Red at the top, green at the bottom (also with some cloud). Photo: Dan Whiter.
Sometimes you can see a thin bit of red or purple on the very bottom of the aurora – that comes from molecular nitrogen (N2 and N2+). There are actually emissions from nitrogen in almost the whole visible spectrum, but the brightest have wavelengths longer than about 600 nm (red, from N2) and around 428 nm (blue, from N2+). When you see these red and blue colours combined they look purple. These nitrogen emissions mainly come from about the same height range as the bright green from atomic oxygen, but you don't notice them because the green is so much brighter. However, at very low altitudes (in aurora terms!) even the green gets blocked ('quenched') due to collisions in the atmosphere. The nitrogen emissions are very fast so the light is produced before the excited molecule collides, and you see the red and blue without the green as a lower border to the aurora.
Colours in the Aurora Zoo image data
The ASK instrument filters out most of the auroral light, to look at specific colours (one of the reasons we need such sensitive detectors). By a careful choice of filters we can use ASK to measure the energy of the precipitating electrons entering the atmosphere to produce the aurora. The colour of the images in Aurora Zoo represents the energy of the auroral electrons, with yellow being low energy and blue being high energy, with green in the middle (we chose the colour scale to be as friendly to colour blind people as possible).
Imagine throwing a tennis ball into water – the harder you throw it, the deeper it will go into the water. Similarly the more energy the precipitating auroral electrons have, the deeper (lower down) the energy will reach into the atmosphere. One of the ASK cameras records red light from N2 at 673 nm, and another records infra-red light at 777.4 nm, which comes from atomic oxygen. The 777.4 nm light comes from higher up than the 673 nm light, which makes it sensitive to lower energy electrons entering the atmosphere. By comparing the brightness of the two emissions, we can work out the energy of the auroral electrons.

American Crossroads: Digitizing the Vascular Flora of the South Central United States
The advent of data mobilization from biological specimens housed in U.S. institutions has profoundly enhanced the value of museum collections and has allowed scientific questions to be addressed in novel ways. The process of mobilization involves specimen digital image capture, transcription of label data, addition of geographic coordinates, and dissemination of the data through searchable online portals. This four-year project brings together 46 collaborating herbaria to mobilize the data from nearly two million plant specimens collected in the states of Oklahoma and Texas. Most of the herbaria in these states, as well as key herbaria from other states with large Oklahoma and Texas holdings, are participating. Because these two states constitute a major crossroads of North American ecological and plant diversity, digitizing their plant specimen data can serve as a key element for understanding ecosystem evolution across the North American continent.
The project includes data for species of conservation concern, invasives, and environmental health indicators. These data enhance species and habitat conservation and management, and contribute to wide-ranging applications in biodiversity science. Members of plant enthusiast organizations -- such as native plant societies -- are also involved as participants, being very active in specimen data entry. The project will contribute to a globally competitive STEM workforce through workshops and lectures for its technicians, and through practical training for undergraduate interns.
The TORCH Data Portal provides access to specimen data and associated images from our herbaria to facilitate botanical research for the purpose of conservation, management, and education. This is an open access portal powered by Symbiota. Our data records are aggregated by iDigBio, the National Resource for Advancing Digitization of Biodiversity Collections, which is funded by the National Science Foundation. New records are made available as specimens are digitized (imaged, databased, and georeferenced) by participating herbaria. If you are interested in further assisting with digitization efforts, please contact the appropriate curator or collections manager."
15;Fishing in the past;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/anneoverduin/fishing-in-the-past/about/research;"Fish are important for humans as a food source, but also for biodiversity.
We can learn more about biodiversity (the presence of many plant and animal species) and the history of our culture by looking at the use of fish in the past. Before the study of animals was real science, people (fishers, medics and collectors) exchanged information about animals in collections, objects and images. We extract information from these ancient objects and combine that with a study of the important fish books of the 16th-19th centuries (e.g. the works of Belon, Artedi, Willughby, Rondelet and Salviani). Within this project people from art and social science work together with biologists and fish experts. The result is a gathering of information about fish in the past, which other people will have access to. In the end, this information may help to throw new light on issues of long-term European biodiversity. The project will collect a large amount of information about European aquatic animals in the 16th -19th centuries: concerning species, names, pictures, spatial distribution, and uses/functions. Art is an underrated source of information. Between 1500 and 1850 fish were a popular subject for painters. Still-lives and market scenes give an idea of the use of fishes in the past. These old paintings learn us which fishes were caught, sold and consumed. Combined with information about biodiversity, we will be able to study the link between fish consumption, biodiversity and major events in the past.

We aim at creating a large gathering of information extracted from fish art. Within this gathering there will be information about the painting such as the date of the painting as well as information about the fish species, and commercial use. With this information, it will be possible to link the occurrence of fish species on paintings and their commercial purpose to certain periods in time. After the project has finished, our project will for the first time provide a vast, unique fund of information to serve research purposes of other scholars and bio-scientists. It will be important in particular to the long-term study of aquatic biodiversity in Europe (1550 until 1880). Variation in species distribution found in sources from the past may provide (further) evidence of climatic change (e.g. the ""Little Ice Age"", which began c.1550), pollution, migration of fish , etc. Together with other types of evidence, this historical information can become important to current debates on maritime and freshwater biodiversity, overfishing, and the (re-)introduction of locally extinct species. Another important question we will be able to answer with this gathering of information, is whether artists painted species that were easily available, whether they concentrated on rare species, how often they painted exotic species that did not occur in their own country, and whether they combine species from different locations in one piece of art.
You can help!
You can help us by giving the fish from the past a name. We have already selected still-lives, prints and market scenes with fish, but the species names are unknown. We have included paintings from the two major art institutions from the Netherlands. Together this includes already more than 2000 pieces of art, and possibly more will be added later. Many of the paintings involve more than one species. This means that we cannot identify them all by ourselves. Help us identify the species so we can learn more about our cultural history and changes in the biodiversity of fishes."
16;Seal Watch;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/cmfoley/seal-watch/about/research;"Why Study Seals?
As top predators, seals are considered sentinels of changes within their ecosystem. Because they spend the majority of their life in water and fall at the top of the food chain, variation in the size or structure of their populations may be representative of larger changes to the dynamic ocean ecosystems. We hope to measure these changes year-round at a large geographical range of study sites in order to better understand how threats to the ecosystem disrupt the dynamics of resident wildlife.
Research Goals
By studying drone and time-lapse images taken throughout the year, we are able to answer a range of research questions. Some of our primary research goals include:
Estimating seal abundance and population dynamics
Clarifying the causes of pup mortality and its relationship to environmental conditions
Understanding how seal breeding systems (e.g. harems, mate guarding) impact population dynamics
Identifying changes in the timing of breeding and how this is affected by environmental conditions
Ultimately, we hope that our research can directly feed into policy as we build evidence to determine important regions for seals and highlight specific regions of concern. There is growing support for Marine Protected Areas at many of our study areas, which would protect these animals, but we must first fill in gaps in our understanding of their populations and behaviors.
Remote Sensing Data
Remote sensing data includes any data we are able to collect without making physical contact with our research subject. This method of data collection is often preferable for wild animals, because it minimizes stress on the animal while allowing researchers to gain tremendous insights into their life and behavior. This type of data includes remotely deployed time-lapse cameras, satellite imagery, and drone imagery. By establishing camera networks across regions where seals breed, particularly in difficult-to-access regions, we hope to capture novel behaviors and study populations that have never before been studied due to their remote locations.
Time-lapse Photos
Drone Imagery
Aerial photos help us to monitor the number of seals in a population over time, and allow us to get highly accurate counts from some of the most remote places on Earth.
Study Sites
South Georgia

Located in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, South Georgia is a British Territory that was once a hub of Southern Ocean sealing. Fur sealing operations on the island throughout the 18th and 19th centuries nearly exterminated breeding populations of Antarctic fur seals, however within decades of the end of harvesting, small breeding populations began to recolonize the island. Elephant sealing continued on South Georgia until 1964. Since the end of sealing on South Georgia, seal populations have increased, however more research is needed to estimate current population size and understand how breeding cycles might be changing in response to climate change.
Antarctic Peninsula

Currently, little is known about populations and habitat use of Antarctic seals on the Antarctic Peninsula. Weddell, leopard, and crabeater seals are common in the region, and by using remote sensing technologies, we hope to learn more about the population and breeding biology of these species.
We Need Your Help

19;Planet Four;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/mschwamb/planet-four/about/research;"Welcome to Planet Four!
Planet Four is a citizen science project designed to help planetary scientists identify and measure features on the surface of Mars . . . the likes of which don’t exist on Earth. All of the images on this site depict the southern polar region, an area of Mars that we know little about, and the majority of which have never been seen by human eyes before!
What am I looking for?
We need your help to find and mark ‘fans’ and ‘blotches’ on the Martian surface. Scientists believe that these features indicate wind direction and speed. By tracking ‘fans’ and ‘blotches’ over the course of several Martian years to see how they form, evolve, disappear and reform, we can help planetary scientists better understand Mars’ climate. We also hope to find out if these features form in the same spot each year and also learn how they change.
So how do these ‘fans’ form?
Fans and blotches appear on the surface of the seasonal ice cap in the spring and early summer. Planetary scientists don’t know exactly how ‘fans’ and ‘blotches’ occur, but many believe that during the autumn a seasonal layer of carbon dioxide ice, otherwise known as dry ice, forms on the southern pole. Rather than measuring days or months, the Martian year is indicated by the solar longitude, Ls. The year begins at Ls = 0, which is the first day of spring in the northern hemisphere and the first day of autumn in the southern hemisphere. In the winter, (beginning at Ls = 90) this layer transforms into translucent slab ice. Once spring arrives, (Ls =180) sunlight is able to penetrate and warm the ground below, causing the ice to sublimate (turn directly from ice into gas) from the bottom.
This sublimation causes gas to become trapped below the ice layer under increasing pressure. When a crack or a rupture develops, the gas bursts, not unlike a geyser, out of the opening carrying along loose material eroded from the ground. When the gas and loose materials reach the surface of the ice, the particles are blown downwind of the vent, landing in fan-shaped deposits. If there isn’t any wind the materials aren’t blown, but rather drop straight down forming a ‘blotch.’
In the summer (beginning at Ls = 270) when the carbon dioxide ice has sublimed away, the 'fans' blend back into the surface material and are no longer visible. This annual process begins again in the following autumn and slowly erodes channels in the ground. These wide, shallow channels, generally less than 2 meters deep, are known as ‘spiders,’ though their technical name is araneiform.
‘Spiders’ are visible in the winter when ice is draped over them, but when the terrain is ice-free in the summer, we can see that the ‘spiders’ are actually channels carved into the surface of Mars. Figure 3 shows the surface of Mars transforming from the spring at Ls = 181.1 to Ls = 325.4, which is mid-summer.
Where do the images come from?
The images on this site come from the HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) camera on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. HiRISE can image Mars with resolutions of 0.3 m/pixel (about 1 foot), resolving objects below a meter across.

Why do you need our help?
There are far too many images for a group of scientists to get through alone and computers are just no good at detecting the features we are trying to mark. The human mind is far superior at analyzing images with the complexity of the Martian surface!
Your markings will be collected together with the markings made by other volunteers on that same image. Taking an average of these markings, we will produce an extremely reliable map of the ‘fan,’ and ‘blotch’ features on the surface of Mars and the first large scale measurement of wind on the planet! The sizes, shapes, and directions of the fans and blotches will help us understand how different regions evolve on the South Pole. Your classifications will help us understand how these differences impact fan and blotch formation, and in particular how the cycle of geysers and fans in these regions changes from Mars year to Mars year and what this can tell us about the Martian climate."

21;Catalina Outer Solar System Survey;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/fulsdavid/catalina-outer-solar-system-survey/about/research;"Welcome to the outer solar system!
Here, you will be looking through archival data from the Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) in an attempt to discover new Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs).
CSS is relentless when it comes to scanning the night sky for asteroids that come close to our planet. From the mountain peaks of southern Arizona, CSS operates almost every clear night making real time discoveries, and has been doing this since 1998.
CSS can find dozens of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) in a single night by looking for objects that move within a sequence of images taken over several minutes. However, NEOs are much closer than TNOs, and therefore in these images TNOs do not appear to move at all. The timescale of minutes is far too short to detect any motion from these distant worlds.
However, using the same night-time field images acquired over several months enables us to detect the motion of TNOs!
Why are we using CSS images to search for TNOs? Unlike other surveys for TNOs and other distant objects, CSS covers more than half of the total sky instead of only small bands near the ecliptic. This wider view is where unknown objects with larger orbital inclinations and other oddities can be found.
How can I find a TNO?
Want to know what it takes to explore the farthest reaches of our solar system? Lots of work goes into the process, but the final step is up to you! Let's walk through the process of finding a TNO to see exactly where you fit in. Below are two images taken from one of the CSS telescopes of the same place in the sky about a month apart.
Can you see two tiny green circles? Don't worry if you can't. Lots of computer processing went in to identifying an object that isn't in the same place in the two images. That would be almost impossible for a human. Lets zoom in below for a closer look.
You can probably now see the two green circles. There are also two yellow circles to show where the object is in the other image. This helps us see more clearly that the object has moved. This is a great start! But if we just look at two images, we tend to find lots and lots of false detections. To help with that, we look at four images. The likelihood of four random smudges, cosmic rays, or image artifacts lining up perfectly across months of time is much less than for two images. However, four images this big is still a LOT of cosmic real estate to look at! To help out, astronomers like to animate the images. That way, real objects look like they are moving. Below is an animation of the first two images plus two more. They were all taken about a month apart from each other.
This is STILL a lot to take in. Especially if the object we are interested in has moved even further than this one. Then we would be zoomed so far out to see the whole path the moving object that we wouldn't be able to see the object, it would be too tiny in the images. Most of this image is excess space, made up of the large gaps between the objects positions. We really only care about the small space where the object would appear from image to image. So we have cut out small squares of the images, and put them right next to each other. This is what it looks like:
This is where you come in! We need you to sort through these animated images, and help us identify which ones have REAL objects like the one above! Now this is an example with a very BRIGHT and well known TNO named Makemake. Most of the new ones we detect will be much fainter. When you are ready click the Classify tab to start. A tutorial will start automatically for your first time. Once you are in the Classify tab, you can always review the tutorial by clicking the tutorial tab."
22;Boston Phoenix, 1974!;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/gmecagni/boston-phoenix-1974/about/research;"The Boston Phoenix
For nearly 50 years, The Boston Phoenix was Boston’s alternative newspaper of record, the first word on social justice, politics, and the arts and music scene. Its intrepid journalists tackled issues from safe sex and AIDS awareness to gay rights, marriage equality, and the legalization of marijuana. Ads for roommates, romantic mates, and band mates—one could find all these and more in the newspaper’s probing, irreverent, entertaining pages.
It ceased publication in March 2013, but in 2015 was preserved for posterity thanks to owner Stephen Mindich’s decision in September to donate the paper’s archives to Northeastern University's Archives and Special Collections.
Research
For any researcher visiting the Northeastern University Archives and Special Collections to research Boston’s political, cultural, and social history between the 1970’s through the early 2000’s, The Boston Phoenix is always recommended as a primary resource, and is widely used both for direct research and as a pedagogical tool.
Although there is a robust description and links to descriptions of the content acquired as part of the Phoenix collection on its portal page, https://phoenix.library.northeastern.edu/home/, there are currently very few direct entry points into the collection. Either a researcher needs to have a reference to a specific article (including a date); the only other option is to browse the bound volumes.
However, the Phoenix did produce two typed card file indices to its paper, which allowed reporters to find similar articles from years past that could help them with their writing. One index is a subject index, the other is an author index. These indices have been scanned, OCRed and made available online here:
Author Indexes, 1973- 1990
Index Subjects, 1974-1986, (bulk 1974-1982)
Filed by year, each author and subject index usually consists of >1000 cards, and includes multiple entry points including date, page, section, title, author, section, and subject.
Additionally, January-June 1974 of The Boston Phoenix had been disbound and digitized for preservation purposes. (It was too fragile for public use). These issues have been made available in the DRS. So if your article is within these date ranges, you can read the article you just indexed! https://repository.library.northeastern.edu/collections/neu:cj82m7888
Goals
The primary goal of the Boston Phoenix 1974! project is to build a community of support for Phoenix publications by asking volunteers to take a deep dive into the arts, culture, politics, and topics of Boston in 1974. This community will hopefully be inspired to read articles they have transcribed and write about them on their favorite social media platform.
The secondary goal is to make the project available for educational purposes. Several faculty members have reached out looking for hands-on projects that could keep their students engaged while studying from home and/or fulfilling experiential education requirements. Educators have successfully used Zooniverse in many different curricular settings; several of these could be modified for Phoenix work. https://blog.zooniverse.org/category/education/
A completed index could also become a prime source for other digital humanities projects, tracking trends in politics, the arts, or news through time. How did so-called 'fringe' causes, such as LGBTQA rights, marijuana decriminalization, and alternative energy become mainstream? What issues in 1974 were at the forefront of the arts and politics sections of the Phoenix?
The tertiary goal of the project is to make a fielded dataset from the 1974 cards, starting with the author index (~1500 cards). If successful, the project could also be expanded to include the 1974 subject file, and to subsequent years. It will be some time before researchers have broad, searchable access to a scanned Phoenix collection that has been OCRed, and still some more time before an accurate article subject index could be created via METS/ALTO or another standard that the library might adopt in the future."
23;Iguanas from Above;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/andreavarela89/iguanas-from-above/about/research;"About Marine Iguanas
The marine iguana (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) is a charismatic and endemic species of the Galápagos Islands that is threatened with extinction. The species consists of 11 subspecies, each of which is unique and important for the survival of the species as a whole. Since the marine iguana is endemic, it is not found anywhere else on earth (not even in zoos!). If it is lost from the Galápagos Islands, then it is lost forever.
Marine Iguanas are the world’s only sea-going lizard, they have amazing adaptations like absorbing their own bone matter to survive hard times, and they inspired the creation of Godzilla. However, marine iguanas face a complex combination of threats due to human activities. These threats include predation by introduced animals like cats, rats, and dogs; marine pollution from oil spills and other sources and climate change.
Conservation authorities want to help, but the problem is that marine iguana colonies are very hard to reach, and so we have never been able to collect good estimates of how many marine iguanas are left and where exactly they can be found. Without this information, effectively conserving them is very difficult (if not impossible!), and we might be losing important populations or even whole subspecies without realizing it.
About the project
By using drones to survey the marine iguana populations, we can collect high quality images from which iguanas can be counted at a later stage. This means we survey much faster and don’t need to physically visit all the colonies. And because we can send the drones from boats, we can do this work with minimal disturbance to the delicate wildlife of the islands.
Through this work, we collect a huge number of images, and it would take our small team a long time to do all the counting. This is why we are asking for your help through our project on Zooniverse. By joining in, you are making an incredibly valuable contribution to preserving the unique wildlife of the Galapagos Islands. We are confident that our Zooniverse project will give us reliable estimates of marine iguana population sizes, but to prove it we will compare these counts with those from ground-based surveys; this will ensure that our work is scientifically rigorous. In addition, you can help us collect data on other species and interesting finds on the islands, and these results will be shared with other conservationists and scientists so that many endangered species can be helped.
Right now we are processing the data from our pilot stage, where we focussed on two islands (San Cristobal and Santa Fe), but we hope to survey the rest of the Islands within the next year so that we will soon have a complete record of the size and location of all key marine iguana populations. This information will be a huge step forward in marine iguana conservation and will really help us to protect these amazing animals from extinction in a rapidly changing world.
Our main aims are to:
*Develop a safe and non-invasive surveying technique alongside a volunteer-based method for quick counting
*Publish the first reliable estimates of the size and location of three highly endangered subspecies
*Create the first species survival plan for the marine iguana to guide their effective protection

25;Embryo Cam;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/embryophenomics/embryo-cam/about/research;"CAPTURING THE MOST DYNAMIC PROCESS OF AN ORGANISM'S LIFE HISTORY
Embryonic development is the most dynamic period of an organisms' life history and has long been a period of fascination to researchers. Embryos change on a minute by minute, hour by hour and day by day basis and trying to capture this dynamic process presents a formidable challenge to scientists.
Our Research group works at the University of Plymouth where we have developed new automated technologies for recording large numbers of aquatic embryos for the duration of their embryonic development and this enables us to capture and study the fundamental process of biological development in an unprecedented way.
Our microscopes generate huge volumes of video data, the next step is to analyse it. Manual analysis is inefficient and so to analyse video efficiently we are turning to artificial intelligence (AI). We are using AI to train the computer to autonomously spot features in developing embryos. For this, we need you! By drawing around features of interest and identifying when the embryo is performing certain behaviours you will provide the computer with ""training data"" so it can learn from you!
This is an important mission because we know that early life stages are sensitive to their environments, but not how sensitive or what they are most sensitive to. We need this understanding as the environment is changing at an unprecedented rate. Therefore, we urgently need your help to generate these data!
OUR TECHNOLOGY
What is EmbryoPhenomics?
EmbryoPhenomics is a technological platform for the autonomous video recording of developing aquatic embryos comprised of a video microscope we call OpenVIM and software called EmbryoCV (computer vision).

Here are three OpenVIM systems in our laboratory
What does it do?
This technology enables us to record and monitor embryos developing under a range of experimental conditions, such as different temperatures that reflect climate change scenarios. Analysing how development is effected by changes in environment, such as changes in temperature, will help scientists understand how climate change may effect animals developing in aquatic environments.

Timelapse video of two snail embryos developing under different environmental temperatures
Why do we need your help?
Your contribution will enable us to extend these technologies to address some of the most pressing challenges of understanding how early life stages are responding to our current environmental crisis. Furthermore, these new technologies are going to be deployed both in the laboratory and out in the environment. Your data will allow us to build intelligent devices that measure what embryos are doing out in their environment! So, please help us train the next generation of technologies for helping to understand our impact on biodiversity!
What are our research goals?
The EmbryoPhenomics research group is establishing new technologies and approaches to research in marine biology and applying these to some of the most pressing research challenges of our time. Our goal is to drive forward the limits of what is currently possible in research on developmental ecophysiology and to use these new approaches to understand how early life stages are responding in a changing world.

The card file, together with the Preserve’s other natural history collections and weather/phenological data, are valuable for research because of their long-term consistency, providing a record of changes in the natural world over many decades. Each index card contains information similar to a museum specimen label (i.e. date, location, observer’s name, taxonomy), and other pertinent information such as weather, behavior (for animals), phenological information, and historical context. Because these data are so extensive and have been consistently collected over so many years, they create a unique data source for scientists to conduct a range of projects. For instance, our extensive phenological records help demonstrate how climate change is affecting the natural cycles of nature. Is spring coming earlier as the months get warmer? Are animals disappearing from the landscape and invasives taking over? Digitizing this collection will help us to support new research on a variety of scientific topics. Once this project is completed, the data will be available for access on the Environmental Data Initiative platform.
27;AI4Mars;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/hiro-ono/ai4mars/about/research;"Our Motivation
Terrain is important to get around on Mars. Spirit got stuck in a sand pit and ended its mission after 7 years of exploring Mars (but far exceeding its nominal mission length of 90-days). Opportunity and Curiosity also have experienced getting stuck in sand, although they were able to continue on their missions. Don’t you think it would be nice if the Mars rover could identify dangerous terrain by herself? That is what a team at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory is working on using Machine learning – essentially the same technology used by self-driving cars on Earth. To do so, the rover needs training data to learn from.
The Problem
On Earth, researchers across the globe have managed to curate many different datasets for things we encounter in day-to-day life, such as house numbers, cityscapes, random stuff, and maybe most importantly, puppies and kittens!
Sadly, all of this data is of little use for mission critical, autonomous exploration of other celestial bodies...
Our Goal
We're counting on citizen scientists' help in labeling a set of images captured by Mars rovers so that we collectively create the Solar System's first public benchmark for Martian terrain classification. Uncrewed space exploration will depend on the rover knowing where it's safe to drive, land, sleep and hibernate; this project is an early step in that direction.
The Dream
With this dataset, we (that includes YOU) will be able to start work on new machine learning approaches for exploring Mars.

28;Disk Detective;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/ssilverberg/disk-detective/about/research;"Planets form from vast clouds of gas, dust, and chunks of rock---clouds in the shape of disks, with stars in the center. We can find out where planets are forming and where planets probably remain today by searching for stars that are surrounded by these disks. Finding these disks, called “debris disks” or “YSO disks” depending on their age and gas content, has been a major quest of astronomers for the last three decades.
NASA’s WISE mission observed more than two billion sources, including galaxies, stars, nebulae, and asteroids--not to mention image artifacts and noise. Among these two billion sources are thousands of new disks waiting to be discovered.
Here at Disk Detective, you will help astronomers find these disks, homes for extrasolar planets. You'll examine images of disk candidates from NASA's WISE mission, and compare them with images of from four different astronomical surveys: the SkyMapper Southern Sky Survey, the Pan-STARRS survey, the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), and the unWISE coadds of data from the WISE mission. Many of them will be junk, but every now and then you'll find a nice clean image, with no background objects or noise overwhelming the signal. And some of those will be new circumstellar disks!
This new version of the project is Disk Detective 2.0. It's a sequel to a citizen science project launched back in 2014 on the original Zooniverse Ouroboros platform. Disk Detective 1.0 discovered a whole new class of disks, called ""Peter Pan Disks"". Check out some more results from Disk Detective 1.0 here!
What are these ""disks"" we're trying to find?
A circumstellar disk is what it sounds like--it's a belt of material around a star. We typically expect debris disks to appear around main-sequence stars--stars that are in the main part of their life burning hydrogen. These are mostly made up of dust leftover from collisions of planetesimals--rocky bodies that might have eventually formed planets.
We also see disks around stars in their pre-main-sequence period--in the time when stars are actually forming. These disks are variously called Young Stellar Object (YSO) disks because they orbit pre-main sequence stars, or primordial disks because they are made up of material from the cloud that formed the star. These systems are very gas-rich. Some of these systems are known as protoplanetary disks, because they are the disks from which planets form!
To find these disks, we look for infrared excess--stars that have more infrared light than you would expect, which indicates the presence of material the gas and dust has warmed up. Here, we have selected a set of systems that have infrared excess--we are looking for your help to make sure that these systems actually look the way we expect them to (rather than looking like galaxies, or material from the gas and dust between stars).
Why use citizen science for this?
The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) surveyed the full sky in four wavelengths of infrared light, allowing it to discover tens of thousands of circumstellar disks...in and among the other billion sources it found. However, WISE images can confuse a disk-hosting star with a galaxy, or nebulosity between the stars. The most effective way to detect these differences is by visual inspection of objects in multiple wavelengths, including optical and near-infrared light. To evaluate multiple thousands of objects efficiently, we've asked citizen scientists like YOU to help us out!
What happens next?
Once you all decide that an object is a good candidate, the science team springs into action! With your helpful comments on Talk, we investigate the good candidates in astronomical catalogs to weed out certain kinds of false positive that don't show up in our classification data. Then we collect follow-up observations to learn more! The best candidates after this advanced vetting and follow-up become new disk candidates in published professional journal articles!

Travel back to the docks of Daytona Beach, Florida from the 1940's through 70's through the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council's (SAFMC) pilot project FISHstory. This project will train citizen science volunteers to identify and count fish in historic fishing photos. Data collected with your help will provide a novel picture of the fishery prior to dedicated monitoring programs and help improve our understanding of the fishery for several iconic species.
Species composition and length data can be critical to accurately estimate stock productivity and there is very little information from 1940 to 1970 when for-hire fisheries off the Atlantic coast of Florida were gaining popularity. As a result, it’s critical that we fill these data gaps to help evaluate assumptions about stock productivity. Historic photos, untapped sources of this important biological data, can help do just that. Analyzing the photos will help provide better information of what people were catching during this time period, seasonality of their catches, and possibly estimate a rough catch per angler which can provide insights on the health of fish populations.
How FISHstory Got Started
Rusty Hudson, a fisherman out of Daytona Beach, Florida has been involved in South Atlantic U.S. fisheries for many years. He approached fisheries scientists in the region about the large photo archive he had from his family’s fishing fleet in the 1940s-1970s. Rusty saw the value in what these photos could provide - helping document historic catches before dedicated catch monitoring programs began. Working collaboratively with Rusty and scientists in the region, Council staff hatched the idea for the FISHstory project.
So what are you looking at?
Each photo represents a single fishing trip. Groups of passengers would pay to be taken out on one of the vessels within the fleet. These vessels were designed to provide passengers with a comfortable space to fish while the captain and crew made sure they enjoyed their time on the water. The captain and crew would select different fishing locations depending on the weather, time of year, and other factors. When the vessel returned to the dock they would unload the day's catch. These photos were taken to commemorate the customer's day on the water. The photos were retained at the docks for promotional use and the customers could buy a copy for their photo albums. Today the Critter fleet is the last remaining charter service that can be seen within the FISHstory photos, however modern charter services still take advantage of these lucrative fishing grounds.
Validation Process
Because fish identification can be challenging, we have a team of fish ID experts, comprised of both scientists and fishermen, who will help review photos when there isn't agreement of the types of fish found in a photo. To learn more about this process or to request to be part of the Validation Team, drop us a line in the ""Talk"" section.
About The South Atlantic Fishery Management Council
The South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC) is headquartered in Charleston, South Carolina and is responsible for managing fisheries in federal waters from the North Carolina/Virginia border to the Florida Keys. Federal waters refers to waters 3 to 200 miles offshore. The council is made up of 13 voting members including representatives from the commercial and recreational fishing sectors along with representatives from each state in the region. We manage 70 different species and have 7 different fisheries management plans. To learn more about SAFMC or to get involved, please visit our website: safmc.net
SAFMC Citizen Science Program
The Council's Citizen Science Program was developed over the course of three years with the guidance of a wide array of stakeholders and partners. The aim was to build a program that would engage fishermen, scientists, and managers in co-creating citizen science projects that would align with the Council's research needs. The projects would collect new data to supplement existing data collection programs and be used to develop fisheries management strategies and considered for use in stock assessments.

FISHstory Project Location
FISHstory includes photos of fishing trips departing from Inlet Harbor and Timmons Fish Camp in Daytona Beach, Florida. These locations were family run operations with multiple vessels. Today fishing charter trips still leave out of Inlet Harbor, while Timmons Fish Camp has since become a seafood restaurant.
Fishing locations varied depending on the vessel, season, weather, or even day. Because of this the depth of water fished and, subsequently, the species caught vary. The maps below show some of the typical fishing locations.

Meet The Captains and Vessels
FISHstory involves not just fish, but people as well! Our photos show fishing and family history. The men and women shown in the FISHstory photos were born and raised on the water and their passion for fishing shows.
Rusty Hudson

Russell Howard Hudson, aka Rusty, was born in 1955 in Greenville, SC. His fishing career started at an early age. By age 4, Rusty was fishing with his family at Timmons Fish Camp in Ponce Park, FL. Because he was a child in a US Air Force family, he spent over three years in Japan.
By 1964 Rusty had returned to FL and was working aboard both the Mako and the Broadbill with Captain Jake Stone, his grandfather, and Captain Bob Stone, his uncle. Rusty also worked aboard The Flamingo, another one of Jake Stone’s vessels, and worked within the commercial fishing and shrimping sector with other captains in the Inlet Harbor fleet.
Rusty has provided FISHstory with not only the historic photos documenting his family’s trips on the water, but a wealth of knowledge on identifying fish, information on the state of fisheries at the time, regional fish names, and FISHstory design input. Without him FISHstory would not be possible.

The Allies liberated the concentration camps 75 years ago. This year, the corona pandemic has made it impossible for people to come together at memorial sites to remember the many millions of victims who were imprisoned, exploited, and murdered there by the National Socialists under inhumane conditions. The “Every Name Counts” project provides a simple way for anyone to take part in active remembrance without leaving the house.
Objective of the project
Our goal is to ensure that all the names in the millions of documents stored in the Arolsen Archives can be found in the online archive – so that people all over the world can easily access information on the fate of their relatives.
The Arolsen Archives - Who we are
The Arolsen Archives are an international center on Nazi persecution with the world’s most comprehensive archive on the victims and survivors of National Socialism. The collection has information on about 17.5 million people and belongs to UNESCO’s Memory of the World. It contains documents on the various victim groups targeted by the Nazi regime and is an important source of knowledge for society today.
What we do
The Arolsen Archives are committed to preserving their unique collection of documents on Nazi persecution and to making them accessible worldwide. We search for the traces of victims and survivors of the National Socialist terror regime and, even today, we are still helping to reunite families torn apart by the Holocaust, the persecution of minorities, and forced labor.
In 1998, staff started to digitize the documents in Bad Arolsen. Today, 85 to 90 percent of the holdings have already been scanned. These documents should be accessible to as many people as possible. This is why the Arolsen Archives are publishing more and more of their holdings in their Online Archive.
The Challenge: to create a digital record of all the names and all the information
Many millions of names are already searchable in our Online Archive. However, the name search can only be successful if the documents have been digitized and saved together with the names they contain (i.e. if so-called metadata have been created). This data is currently missing for a large number of lists in the online archive. This means that hundreds of thousands of names that are on lists cannot be found in the online archive. However, it takes a long time to record this information and, considering the millions of documents involved, it really is a huge task.
This is why we need your help!"

32;Spiral Graph;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/astro-lab-ncmns/spiral-graph/about/research;"Help us map out spiral arms in galaxies
The ability of the human brain find and process patterns is far superior to any computer. Spiral patterns in disk galaxies are easily seen and followed by people but computer algorithms have a harder time determining where spirals begin and end, especially if they aren't continuous. That's where you come in! By tracing the spiral arms you see in galaxy images, you are giving our computer algorithm a boost so it can accurately measure how tightly wrapped the structure is. The degree of wrapping of the spiral arms is called the pitch angle[1]. If a spiral pattern has very tightly wrapped arms, it has a small pitch angle. If it the spiral pattern is very open, it has a large pitch angle.
[2]
Why is measuring pitch angle important?
The pitch angle of spiral arms relates to other parameters of the host galaxy that are more difficult and time consuming to measure. These parameters include the mass of the black hole found in the nucleus[3], bulge stellar mass[4], galaxy total stellar mass[5], maximum rotational velocity, and dark matter content of the galaxy[6]. By measuring the spiral arm pitch angle we can quickly and easily estimate these parameters and identify interesting galaxies for more detailed, follow-up telescope observations.
For example, we can use pitch angles to search for black holes in the centers of galaxies with masses that range from hundreds to hundreds of thousands of times the mass of our Sun (intermediate mass black holes). Most galaxies have central black holes with masses that range from millions to billions of times the mass of our Sun (supermassive black holes). So far, less than a half-dozen intermediate mass black hole candidates have been found and scientists are looking for more galaxies that host these rare objects in order to better understand their evolution.
The Method
The method to measure spiral arm pitch angle has two main steps: (1) deprojecting the galaxy and (2) tracing the spiral arms.
1. Deprojection
Spiral galaxies are observed at various inclinations relative to our line of sight. Below are photographs of a 3D printed model spiral galaxy taken at different angles to illustrate the point.
Nearly edge-on Moderately inclined Nearly face-on
In order to accurately measure the spiral arm pitch angle of a galaxy, we first need to approximate what it looks like when viewed face-on. The first task is to ""deproject"" a galaxy to a face-on view. This is done by fitting an ellipse to the outer visible edges of the galaxy[7] and then stretching along the short axis of the ellipse until it becomes a circle. This is illustrated below with our model.
Inclined galaxy Fit an ellipse to the galaxy Rotate the ellipse Stretch the ellipse to a circle
2. Tracing
Once a galaxy has been deprojected, the arms are now ready to be traced. The traced arms tell us how many visible arms the galaxy has and gives us a model of where the arms visibly begin and end in the image. This is illustrated below.
Deprojected galaxy One arm traced All arms traced Model of galaxy arms
The model created by you will then be plugged into a computer algorithm called P2DFFT[8] and the pitch angle will be calculated. If a galaxy is found to have a pitch angle in the range expected for an intermediate mass black hole, it will be flagged for further analysis and possible future telescope observations!
3. Real Images
The actual galaxy images in this project come from data release 5 of the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) and are in the g-band. When a DECaLS image of the galaxy is not suitable or available, we then use images from data release 14 (DR14) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The real images won't be as clear and crisp as the images of the 3D printed model, but that's precisely why we need your eyes to help us.

33;Aurora Zoo;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/dwhiter/aurora-zoo/about/research;"How does nature create such a beautiful show?
The aurora borealis, or northern lights, is a natural light show that forms in a ring around the Earth's north pole (the aurora australis forms around the south pole). Aurora comes from the collisions of charged particles from space colliding with the gas particles in the Earth's atmosphere.
The University of Southampton operates a camera system called ASK (Auroral Structure and Kinetics, see Dahlgren et al. 2008) for studying the aurora. ASK has telescopes to look at just a small part of the sky in detail, so we can see the smallest shapes in the aurora. Its detectors are very sensitive so that we can use short exposure times and see fast movements. ASK has been operating on Svalbard, in the high Arctic, since 2007, and automatically takes data whenever it is dark. We now have thousands of hours of video of the aurora, most of which has never been looked at. So far we've just done “event studies”, where we have investigated specific auroral events in detail, but we want to be able to do statistical studies on the ASK data – that's where Aurora Zoo comes in!

ASK is located at the EISCAT Svalbard Radar. Photo: Dan Whiter.
What is the aim of the project?
There are two main science aims of Aurora Zoo:
Understand how different small-scale shapes and movements in the aurora are formed.
Learn what conditions are needed for those different shapes and movements to happen.
We'll achieve those aims through Aurora Zoo by using the huge number of classifications to do bigger statistical studies than have ever been done before. We're sure that citizen scientists will also find exciting and unusual events to study in more detail – things nobody has ever seen before.
Why does this research matter?
A large but highly variable amount of energy enters the atmosphere from space through auroral processes, with a power approximately equal to the power consumption of the UK. That energy mainly ends up as heat, produced by electric currents associated with the aurora and by friction between ions (charged atoms and molecules) and the neutral atmosphere. We don't yet have a good understanding how the energy is transferred from space into the atmosphere, and it's difficult to predict or even measure how much heating there will be, where it will be, and how much it is focused or spread out over an area. These are important questions because the energy from aurora needs to be included in atmospheric and climate models. The small-scale shapes and movements in the aurora are a window on the physics of the energy transfer processes present, so understanding how they are formed is an important step towards understanding the energy flow into the atmosphere.
Studying aurora may also help us to predict and prepare for natural disasters such as geomagnetic storms. These storms are powerful enough to cause satellites to malfunction and electrical power-grids to fail, destroying our global power and communication systems. In 1989, a large storm caused a 9-hour blackout in Quebec, Canada. Immediately before the disruption to power, scientists observed particularly bright aurora which could have served as a warning for the upcoming disaster. Studying aurora helps us to understand the different ways space weather can affect life here on Earth.
More generally, understanding the aurora could help in a wide range of science fields. The upper atmosphere and near-Earth space, where the aurora is located and formed, is in a state of matter called plasma. 99% of the observable universe is thought to be plasma, and plasma also occurs in things like fusion reactors and lightning, so it's important for us to learn as much as we can about it. Although it is possible to create plasma artificially in a lab, studying aurora gives scientists a natural laboratory unlike any other!
How can I contribute to Aurora Zoo?
In Aurora Zoo you will see short video clips recorded by the ASK instrument, and we ask you to tell us what shape the aurora has, what movement there is, and how fuzzy (or diffuse) the aurora is. The clips are about 1s long, but you can slow them down and look at them frame by frame if you like. To start classifying aurora just press “Classify” at the top right of this page. There is a short tutorial you should see the first time you go to the classify page which we recommend you read carefully, and you can see examples of the different types of aurora in the “Field Guide” (tab on the right edge of the screen). You might also want to have a look at the FAQ page.
How is the aurora formed?
The light of the aurora has its origins in the Sun through a sequence of processes that are generally understood; however there are many unknowns in this complex system. The Sun ejects huge numbers of charged particles into space, collectively called 'plasma', which make up the solar wind. This outflowing solar wind plasma is always there, but there are big changes in its density and speed. These changes can eventually be seen as variations in auroral activity on Earth, so the Sun and its solar wind provide a source of energy to the Earth’s upper atmosphere which is incredibly variable. However, the aurora is always present somewhere in the Earth’s high latitudes.
The way that the energy is transferred from the solar wind to the Earth is complex and involves interactions between the magnetic field of the Sun, which is carried along by the solar wind, and the magnetic field of the Earth. The latter is contained in a region called the magnetosphere.

Earth's Magnetosphere. Credit: NASA/Goddard/Aaron Kasse (https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/multimedia/magnetosphere.html).
When the solar wind reaches the Earth's magnetic field, it slows down abruptly, causing a shockwave called the bow shock. Depending on the direction of the magnetic fields where they come close together, a process called 'magnetic reconnection' can occur, which allows plasma from the solar wind to enter the magnetosphere. These particles (mainly electrons but also protons), as well as others which have escaped from Earth's atmosphere, are the eventual source of the aurora. The particles are constrained to move in spirals along the Earth’s magnetic field lines, and gain hugely in energy before they descend and collide with the atoms and molecules of the upper atmosphere. The transfer of energy to these particles is the key unknown, and is very dependent on the activity of the Sun and the subsequent influence of the solar wind. The shape of Earth's magnetic field means the particles are funnelled down into the polar regions, creating an oval of aurora around each pole. When the electrons and protons enter the atmosphere we say they are 'precipitating'.
The precipitating electrons and protons hit the atoms and molecules in the air, causing them to lose electrons through a process called ionisation. These secondary electrons then go on to collide with other atoms and molecules, creating further ionisation but also giving those atoms and molecules a bit of extra energy (called 'exciting' them). When the excited atoms and molecules relax to lower energy levels they emit the extra energy as light – the aurora. The colour of light released depends on the type of atom or molecule that it came from. A viewer on the ground would see mostly green and red from atomic oxygen, but also a different red from molecular nitrogen on the lower border of the aurora. This is quite similar to the process occurring in lightning, but the colour is different because the atmospheric pressure and composition are different at the high altitudes where the aurora is formed. The precipitating electrons are charged and carry an electric current, just like the electric current flowing in lightning, but the aurora is about 20-100 times higher than a cloud producing a lightning flash.
Shapes and movement in the aurora
On a large scale, the Aurora is usually made up of arcs, sometimes called bands. An arc is like a line of aurora which stretches across the sky, usually in an east-west direction.

An auroral arc over river Kitinen, Sodankylä, Finland. Photo: Dan Whiter.
Arcs can look “quiet” without much internal structure or movement, but they can also be highly dynamic with rays, curls and folds along their length. Rays are lines which trace out the Earth's magnetic field lines, and can make an arc look like a curtain hanging in the air. Each ray is actually a small curl or fold in the arc, making it thicker and therefore more bright at that point. The rays can move rapidly along the arc in spectacular, dynamic displays.

A rayed auroral arc. Photo: Dan Whiter.
When an arc (or several arcs) are almost directly overhead, the rays inside the arcs all seem to point at the same spot in the sky, so it is like looking through a tunnel of aurora. When this happens it is called a corona, often producing an amazing sight. The aurora in a corona isn't really different from other rayed aurora – the difference is where you are viewing it from.

Looking straight up at a corona. Photo: Dan Whiter.

More crazy aurora viewed from below. Photo: Dan Whiter.
Auroral arcs typically drift southwards (in the northern hemisphere) across the sky, before either fading or moving northwards again, or if an event called a magnetospheric substorm occurs then they can explode poleward so that the aurora fills the sky. Svalbard is so far north that on the nightside of the planet the aurora usually appears on the southern horizon first and moves northward, before retreating back to the South. From Svalbard ASK can also see aurora on the dayside of the planet, where arcs are often less clear and we see what look like isolated rays and patches of aurora.
The ASK instrument looks straight up along the Earth's magnetic field through telescopes, so it can see the detail of the curls, folds, and other shapes inside an arc or patch in high resolution. Looking at the aurora on these small scales reveals a wide variety of shapes and movements which you can't normally see with your eyes. It is difficult to define a simple classification scheme for all of these features, but with the help of citizen scientists we have come up with a scheme which we think will cover most of what you can see in Aurora Zoo. For details of the shapes and movements in the Aurora Zoo classification scheme please see the Field Guide (tab on the right of screen).
Colours of the aurora
The pictures in Aurora Zoo are actually false colour (more information below). When you see the aurora with your eyes it usually looks green or red. Sometimes it has other colours, like purple and white, but that's usually because you are seeing a mix of colours or because the aurora is too faint for your eyes to determine the colour. The green and red you see are very specific colours (specific wavelengths), but actually there are many other (usually fainter) colours in the aurora, all mixed together.
The bright green comes from atomic oxygen (O), and has a wavelength of 557.7 nm. This emission has a “lifetime” of about 1 second, which means that on average it takes about 1 second for the light to be produced after the oxygen is excited (i.e. absorbs some energy). Most red colour you see is also from atomic oxygen, with a wavelength of 630 nm. This red emission has a much longer lifetime of about 2 minutes. Below about 200 km altitude the excited oxygen collides with other atoms and molecules in the atmosphere before it has time to produce the red light, whereas higher up the air is so thin that collisions between atoms are very rare. So you can only see the red light coming from very high up, about 200-500 km above the ground, above the brightest green light which comes from about 100-150 km.

Red at the top, green at the bottom (also with some cloud). Photo: Dan Whiter.
Sometimes you can see a thin bit of red or purple on the very bottom of the aurora – that comes from molecular nitrogen (N2 and N2+). There are actually emissions from nitrogen in almost the whole visible spectrum, but the brightest have wavelengths longer than about 600 nm (red, from N2) and around 428 nm (blue, from N2+). When you see these red and blue colours combined they look purple. These nitrogen emissions mainly come from about the same height range as the bright green from atomic oxygen, but you don't notice them because the green is so much brighter. However, at very low altitudes (in aurora terms!) even the green gets blocked ('quenched') due to collisions in the atmosphere. The nitrogen emissions are very fast so the light is produced before the excited molecule collides, and you see the red and blue without the green as a lower border to the aurora.
Colours in the Aurora Zoo image data
The ASK instrument filters out most of the auroral light, to look at specific colours (one of the reasons we need such sensitive detectors). By a careful choice of filters we can use ASK to measure the energy of the precipitating electrons entering the atmosphere to produce the aurora. The colour of the images in Aurora Zoo represents the energy of the auroral electrons, with yellow being low energy and blue being high energy, with green in the middle (we chose the colour scale to be as friendly to colour blind people as possible).
Imagine throwing a tennis ball into water – the harder you throw it, the deeper it will go into the water. Similarly the more energy the precipitating auroral electrons have, the deeper (lower down) the energy will reach into the atmosphere. One of the ASK cameras records red light from N2 at 673 nm, and another records infra-red light at 777.4 nm, which comes from atomic oxygen. The 777.4 nm light comes from higher up than the 673 nm light, which makes it sensitive to lower energy electrons entering the atmosphere. By comparing the brightness of the two emissions, we can work out the energy of the auroral electrons.

American Crossroads: Digitizing the Vascular Flora of the South Central United States
The advent of data mobilization from biological specimens housed in U.S. institutions has profoundly enhanced the value of museum collections and has allowed scientific questions to be addressed in novel ways. The process of mobilization involves specimen digital image capture, transcription of label data, addition of geographic coordinates, and dissemination of the data through searchable online portals. This four-year project brings together 46 collaborating herbaria to mobilize the data from nearly two million plant specimens collected in the states of Oklahoma and Texas. Most of the herbaria in these states, as well as key herbaria from other states with large Oklahoma and Texas holdings, are participating. Because these two states constitute a major crossroads of North American ecological and plant diversity, digitizing their plant specimen data can serve as a key element for understanding ecosystem evolution across the North American continent.
The project includes data for species of conservation concern, invasives, and environmental health indicators. These data enhance species and habitat conservation and management, and contribute to wide-ranging applications in biodiversity science. Members of plant enthusiast organizations -- such as native plant societies -- are also involved as participants, being very active in specimen data entry. The project will contribute to a globally competitive STEM workforce through workshops and lectures for its technicians, and through practical training for undergraduate interns.
The TORCH Data Portal provides access to specimen data and associated images from our herbaria to facilitate botanical research for the purpose of conservation, management, and education. This is an open access portal powered by Symbiota. Our data records are aggregated by iDigBio, the National Resource for Advancing Digitization of Biodiversity Collections, which is funded by the National Science Foundation. New records are made available as specimens are digitized (imaged, databased, and georeferenced) by participating herbaria.

35;Fishing in the past;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/anneoverduin/fishing-in-the-past/about/research;"Fish are important for humans as a food source, but also for biodiversity.
We can learn more about biodiversity (the presence of many plant and animal species) and the history of our culture by looking at the use of fish in the past. Before the study of animals was real science, people (fishers, medics and collectors) exchanged information about animals in collections, objects and images. We extract information from these ancient objects and combine that with a study of the important fish books of the 16th-19th centuries (e.g. the works of Belon, Artedi, Willughby, Rondelet and Salviani). Within this project people from art and social science work together with biologists and fish experts. The result is a gathering of information about fish in the past, which other people will have access to. In the end, this information may help to throw new light on issues of long-term European biodiversity. The project will collect a large amount of information about European aquatic animals in the 16th -19th centuries: concerning species, names, pictures, spatial distribution, and uses/functions. Art is an underrated source of information. Between 1500 and 1850 fish were a popular subject for painters. Still-lives and market scenes give an idea of the use of fishes in the past. These old paintings learn us which fishes were caught, sold and consumed. Combined with information about biodiversity, we will be able to study the link between fish consumption, biodiversity and major events in the past.

We aim at creating a large gathering of information extracted from fish art. Within this gathering there will be information about the painting such as the date of the painting as well as information about the fish species, and commercial use. With this information, it will be possible to link the occurrence of fish species on paintings and their commercial purpose to certain periods in time. After the project has finished, our project will for the first time provide a vast, unique fund of information to serve research purposes of other scholars and bio-scientists. It will be important in particular to the long-term study of aquatic biodiversity in Europe (1550 until 1880). Variation in species distribution found in sources from the past may provide (further) evidence of climatic change (e.g. the ""Little Ice Age"", which began c.1550), pollution, migration of fish , etc. Together with other types of evidence, this historical information can become important to current debates on maritime and freshwater biodiversity, overfishing, and the (re-)introduction of locally extinct species. Another important question we will be able to answer with this gathering of information, is whether artists painted species that were easily available, whether they concentrated on rare species, how often they painted exotic species that did not occur in their own country, and whether they combine species from different locations in one piece of art.
You can help!
You can help us by giving the fish from the past a name. We have already selected still-lives, prints and market scenes with fish, but the species names are unknown. We have included paintings from the two major art institutions from the Netherlands. Together this includes already more than 2000 pieces of art, and possibly more will be added later. Many of the paintings involve more than one species. This means that we cannot identify them all by ourselves. Help us identify the species so we can learn more about our cultural history and changes in the biodiversity of fishes."
36;Seal Watch;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/cmfoley/seal-watch/about/research;"Why Study Seals?
As top predators, seals are considered sentinels of changes within their ecosystem. Because they spend the majority of their life in water and fall at the top of the food chain, variation in the size or structure of their populations may be representative of larger changes to the dynamic ocean ecosystems. We hope to measure these changes year-round at a large geographical range of study sites in order to better understand how threats to the ecosystem disrupt the dynamics of resident wildlife.
Research Goals
By studying drone and time-lapse images taken throughout the year, we are able to answer a range of research questions. Some of our primary research goals include:
Estimating seal abundance and population dynamics
Clarifying the causes of pup mortality and its relationship to environmental conditions
Understanding how seal breeding systems (e.g. harems, mate guarding) impact population dynamics
Identifying changes in the timing of breeding and how this is affected by environmental conditions
Ultimately, we hope that our research can directly feed into policy as we build evidence to determine important regions for seals and highlight specific regions of concern. There is growing support for Marine Protected Areas at many of our study areas, which would protect these animals, but we must first fill in gaps in our understanding of their populations and behaviors.
Remote Sensing Data
Remote sensing data includes any data we are able to collect without making physical contact with our research subject. This method of data collection is often preferable for wild animals, because it minimizes stress on the animal while allowing researchers to gain tremendous insights into their life and behavior. This type of data includes remotely deployed time-lapse cameras, satellite imagery, and drone imagery. By establishing camera networks across regions where seals breed, particularly in difficult-to-access regions, we hope to capture novel behaviors and study populations that have never before been studied due to their remote locations.
Time-lapse Photos
Drone Imagery
Aerial photos help us to monitor the number of seals in a population over time, and allow us to get highly accurate counts from some of the most remote places on Earth.
Study Sites
South Georgia

Located in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, South Georgia is a British Territory that was once a hub of Southern Ocean sealing. Fur sealing operations on the island throughout the 18th and 19th centuries nearly exterminated breeding populations of Antarctic fur seals, however within decades of the end of harvesting, small breeding populations began to recolonize the island. Elephant sealing continued on South Georgia until 1964. Since the end of sealing on South Georgia, seal populations have increased, however more research is needed to estimate current population size and understand how breeding cycles might be changing in response to climate change.
Antarctic Peninsula

Currently, little is known about populations and habitat use of Antarctic seals on the Antarctic Peninsula. Weddell, leopard, and crabeater seals are common in the region, and by using remote sensing technologies, we hope to learn more about the population and breeding biology of these species.
We Need Your Help
We have collected an abundance of photographic data and continue to collect more every day, but there's simply so much data we can't analyze it by ourselves. That's where you come in. We need your help annotating images so we can convert these photographs into a database we can use to answer ecological questions. We're asking you to identify and tag each seal you see (see the 'Tutorial' for more information)."
37;Maturity of Baby Sounds;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/chiarasemenzin/maturity-of-baby-sounds/about/research;"The Maturity of Baby Sounds
Did you know that, well before saying real words, children produce very different sounds with their mouths? Already at birth, they cry and cry. We all know these sounds! A little later, they also begin to babble - that is, produce sounds closer to those of adult speech. These are the ones that interest us the most.
We know roughly that these sounds get more complex as the baby grows older, but we don't know whether this happens at similar rates regardless of the language the baby is learning. We are also interested in seeing whether babbling is different in infants that go on to have a medical diagnosis, such as Autism.
Today, most of the babbling data for babies comes from the United States and from typically-developing babies. With your help, we will be able to generate data for many more languages, cultures, and populations. Here is a world map with some of the locations in which our data were gathered:
Our data are really special because the child him/herself wears a recorder all day long. Then we analyze these 10-16h long recordings with software to try to find when the child is talking. But sometimes the software is wrong, and actually one hears an adult or just noise. We cut our clips really short to protect the identity and privacy of the participating families.
As volunteers like you label these clips, we can look at what proportion of the clips contain speech sounds rather than purely emotional sounds (crying and laughing). And we can also look at what proportion of those speech sounds are ""complex"" (what we call canonical in the field guide). We are looking forward to answering these questions:
Do babies everywhere produce more speech and fewer crying sounds as the grow?
Is the ratio of more versus less complex speech sounds the same regardless of which language the baby is learning? Or are there differences between children learning English versus, for instance, a Pidgin language that has only 10 consonants, or a Khoisan language that has 100 consonants?
Do these changes happen at the same rate in children at risk of language impairment?"
38;Radio Galaxy Zoo: LOFAR;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/chrismrp/radio-galaxy-zoo-lofar/about/research;"What are we looking for?
Supermassive Black Holes
Almost all of the sources found in the LOFAR radio survey of the northern sky are what astronomers call Active Galactic Nuclei (or AGNs for short). Active Galactic Nuclei are powered by supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies. Nearby material passes very close to these supermassive black holes and is flung out in the form of two immense jets. These jets are visible at radio wavelengths and observing this radio emission can tell astronomers a lot about the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes.

The first image shows an artist's impression of two radio jets ejected from a supermassive black hole in the center of the large foreground galaxy. It also shows all kinds of background galaxies that we would see with a good optical telescope. The second image shows a real example of two jets around a supermassive black hole found by observing with the LOFAR radio telescope!
Star forming galaxies
In some cases, LOFAR also picks up nearby galaxies where much star formation is going on. In this case, we do not see radio jets but the shape of the radio emission follows the shape of the nearby galaxy closely. To visualise this, we show the radio emission as yellow lines (called contours) in the foreground and the image from an optical telescope in the background.
Why do we need your help?
Reassembling radio sources
The LOFAR survey has made images of hundreds of thousands of these jets and galaxies, which have been identified by an automatic ""source finder"" computer program. Unfortunately, this program is not perfect and sometimes it splits a single radio source into multiple separate components. Radio astronomers need your help associating the components that the source finder program mistakenly separated. This will let us reconstruct the full radio sources from their separated components.

This image also shows a pair of radio jets found with the LOFAR telescope. This time, the radio emission is visualised as yellow lines (called contours) and the blue ellipses surround what the source finder thinks are separate sources. In this case, the presence of three ellipses shows that the source has been incorrectly divided into three separate components. You can fix that mistake by associating the components!
Finding the Active Galactic Nuclei
Astronomers are also interested in identifying the galaxy that powers the radio emission. These galaxies can be seen at visible wavelengths, and provide additional data to help astronomers determine, for example, the distance to the observed radio source.

The image above now shows sources found with an optical telescope behind the contours and ellipses. The host galaxy is visible in the background as the bright source in between the two lobes.
Getting started
To help you get started we've built a dedicated training workflow and a step-by-step tutorial video that will guide you through the classification process.
If you're new to LOFAR Galaxy Zoo we recommend that you open the tutorial video in a separate browser tab and then and then click on Tutorial on the homepage to go straight to the training workflow now.
If you prefer, we also have a text-based tutorial that should pop up the first time you start classifying, and it can be revisited as often as needed by clicking on the handy ""Tutorial"" button that is displayed in the classification interface. The main workflow also has 10 'gold standard' images where experts have found the right answer. These images help you get started by providing feedback and help us calibrate the responses. However, you will only see these images if you are logged in!
We've also provided a Field Guide that contains useful examples of the different types of radio sources you will encounter, as well as useful tips and some pitfalls to avoid.
If you ever feel uncertain, remember that every image will be seen by several people, and when the results are inconsistent they will be analysed in more detail by the experts. You don't have to get it right every time!

Background
Project PHaEDRA is an initiative by the Wolbach Library at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. PHaEDRA stands for Preserving Harvard’s Early Data and Research in Astronomy. The goal of the project is to catalog, digitize, transcribe, and create metadata for over 2,500 notebooks produced by early 20th century women computers at the Harvard College Observatory. These women made advancements and discoveries in the field of astronomy, many of which are still used today. We hope that this project will make this remarkable set of items accessible in the future. Modern researchers will be able to connect these notebooks with the physical glass plate photographs that the astronomers used to make their discoveries.
About the Astronomers
Annie Jump Cannon worked at the Harvard College Observatory from 1896-1940. She attended Wellesley College in Massachusetts, where she studied physics and astronomy. She became a computer at the Harvard College Observatory. She developed a star classification system that is still used today. According to her classification system, stars can be either O, B, A, F, G, K or M, with O being the hottest stars and M being the coolest. In 1911 she was named Curator of Astronomical Photographs at at the Harvard College Observatory. During her career, she had also discovered 300 variable stars, five new stars, and one spectroscopic binary. She was the first female recipient of an honorary doctorate from Oxford University.
Williamina Fleming was born in Scotland and was one of the first Harvard Computers. She worked at the Harvard College Observatory from 1881-1911, and became the first Curator of Astronomical Photographs in 1899. Throughout her career, Fleming discovered 10 novae, 52 nebulae, and 310 new variable stars. In 1890, she discovered the now famous Horsehead Nebula while examining one of Harvard’s glass plate photographs.
Evelyn Leland was an astronomer who worked at the Harvard College Observatory from 1889-1925. She worked as an assistant to Edward Pickering at the observatory; these female assistants made up the Harvard Computers. She calculated stellar spectra and became an expert on variable stars from the glass photographic plates. She worked on the glass plate photographs shipped from the Arequipa Observatory in Peru to Cambridge, Massachusetts. Based on her work on variable stars, she coauthored Harvard Observatory publications such as ""20 New Variable Stars in Harvard Map, Nos. 2, 5, 32, 44, and 53"". Leland passed away in 1930 at the age of 60.
Dorrit Hoffleit was an astronomer known for her work on variable stars who lived from 1907 to 2007. She worked at the Harvard College Observatory after receiving a degree in mathematics in 1928. She later earned a Ph.D. in astronomy from Radcliffe College in 1938 and was hired as an astronomer at Harvard. She remained there until starting a job at Yale in 1956. She was an advocate for the women at the Harvard Observatory, frequently writing about them and their accomplishments. Hoffleit frequently wrote about the Observatory Library and the Computers in various capacities, such as for the 'Harvard Library Bulletin', 'Sky and Telescope Magazine', and in 'Notable American Women.' Hoffleit was still doing research in her 90s, and she passed away a month after celebrating her 100th birthday.
Star Notes
Star Notes is a new initiative for Project PHaEDRA with the goal of linking the notebooks back to their original source material: 500,000 glass plate photographs representing the first ever pictures of the visible universe. Each glass plate is identified with a unique ""plate number."" The Harvard Computers would usually record which glass plates they were researching by noting the plate numbers in their notebooks. We need volunteers on Zooniverse to find and transcribe these handwritten plate numbers. This information will improve our understanding of the history of the Harvard Computers and the Astronomical Photographic Plate Collection. It will also will enhance understanding of the individual plates themselves being digitized through DASCH (Digital Access to a Sky Century @ Harvard) and allow researchers in Time Domain Astrophysics to better understand how the Universe is evolving.

40;Notes from Nature - Expedition Arctic Botany;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/cmnbotany/notes-from-nature-expedition-arctic-botany/about/research;"Expedition Arctic Botany
Across Canada’s northern territories, hundreds of specially adapted plant species grow low and slow, making the most of brief summers under the midnight sun. The Canadian Museum of Nature leads an international project to document the plant species across our rapidly changing Arctic, drawing much information from present-day field work and from specimens collected over the past 200+ years.
Many of those specimens reside in the National Herbarium of Canada, having accumulated largely before electronic databases were common. This precious, primary evidence is stored very safely for the current public and future generations, but until we fully digitize the specimens, important patterns and valuable information remain hidden. Until we share them on-line, they will only reach a small fraction of the projects they could benefit.
And that’s where we need your help. By transcribing label information from the Arctic specimens in the National Herbarium of Canada, you’ll help us unlock new insights on northern plant biodiversity, as well as helping everyone who uses the National Herbarium to answer questions related to northern botany…all while learning for yourself about the fascinating species that grow across Arctic Canada, Alaska and Greenland..
Through this new expedition focusing on Canada's Arctic Vascular plants, we have revamped our workflow to transcribe more details from our collection labels. Your help is need to find and record collection date, collection location, environment and co-ordinate data. This data allows researchers to better understand vascular plant distribution and collection events in our Arctic regions.
Canada’s National Herbarium
The Canadian Museum of Nature safeguards one of Canada’s largest natural history collections. The botanical collection alone, known as the National Herbarium, numbers over one million specimens, including the world’s best representation of samples from the Canadian Arctic.
Plants, lichens and algae are collected in nature and then preserved, often by drying. This technique permanently preserves their features and DNA. Staff and volunteers mount the dried specimens on paper, and label them with key information including collection date and location. With specimens dating back to 1766, the National Herbarium documents the flora of Canada through time, creating a rich source of information for research and education in Canada and around the world.
How does transcription change the game?
“Transcription” for this project means categorizing the information that is written or typed on the labels of herbarium specimens and converting to machine-readable format for a database. When information from the unique, hard copies of botanical specimens in our cabinets is transcribed, it helps to create a database can be effectively searched for specimens that meet criteria that are important to experts, educators, students in the many sectors that use the herbarium.
For example, let’s say that a person scrutinizes a specimen sheet, locates the date on which a plant was collected (distinguishing it from the other dates that might appear on the specimen sheet), and then makes sure that the date is accurately typed into the database under the category of “collection date”. That simple act transforms the value and accessibility of the specimen: anyone who then searches the database for specimens collected during a period that includes that date will be able to discover the specimen. Previously, the specimen – and the other valuable information it may have held - would have remained hidden.
In this second vascular plant edition, we invite citizen scientist collaborators to transcribe the where: Collection Location, Environment details and Co-ordinate data. This expanded dataset allows us to answer countless questions, for example:
Location and habitat data describe landscape features and can be used to track changes in habitats over time.
Co-ordinate and elevation data help plot specimen distribution and discover the collection routes of Arctic researchers.
What happens to the data once they're published?
Our data is your data! Once the dataset is complete, you can access them free online.

41;Mapping Historic Skies;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/webster-institute/mapping-historic-skies/about/research;"Mapping Historic Skies
This project is a collaboration between the Adler Planetarium's Collections department and the Adler-Zooniverse team.
The original idea for Mapping Historic Skies came out of an NEH-funded digitization project at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, IL. The Adler collections team digitized more than 4,000 historical constellation maps and depictions, covering a span of 600 years and featuring artistic representations of the sky from around the world. The team realized the potential of this collection for research in the history of astronomy, as well as art history. For example, what if a researcher could compare depictions of a single constellation across this timespan, and from all over the world?
The Zooniverse workflows break down the identification of constellations in the Adler’s historical star maps into simple tasks achievable by anyone--without requiring previous knowledge of astronomy. The end goal is to narrow down the large Adler dataset into images of single, identified constellations.
In time, the cropped, identified images will be added to the Adler's online collections database. This means that online volunteers as well as visitors to the exhibit who participate in Mapping Historic Skies are helping with real research, and are participating as co-creators toward a repository of public knowledge.
Chicago's Night Sky Exhibit
The data from this project will be partially collected through an interactive iPad app, installed in the Adler Planetarium's Chicago's Night Sky exhibit.
The intended audience for this interactive is visitors to the exhibit as well as online participants from all over the world, although these two groups of volunteers will participate in different tasks.
In the exhibit, visitors can use the iPad app to draw boxes around individual constellations (an image can contain as many as 6 constellations). Online volunteers will be able to look at the cropped images and help answer a series of questions to identify the constellation being depicted."
42;Offal Wildlife Watching;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/embeller/offal-wildlife-watching/about/research;"Offal Wildlife Watching: Camera-trap monitoring of hunter provided carrion
Who:
We asked deer hunters in Minnesota, or those that participate in deer camps, to place remote cameras on gut piles from freshly field dressed deer. Volunteers left their cameras to capture pictures from one month to capture all the scavenger species that used the gut pile.
What:
The purpose of this research is to better understand what and when species use deer gut piles provided by hunters across Minnesota. Minnesota offers a unique opportunity to look at this across four different biomes and a large metro area (Click image to enlarge). These areas have differing topography, vegetation, and human land use. All of these things are likely to influence the different scavenger assemblages found in each area. There are also several methods of hunting such as archery, rifle, and shotgun that may influence where a gut pile is located, and which species visit.
Why:
Scavengers have been shown to obtain high quality food from carrion without using the energy needed to capture and kill prey. A large amount of carrion available to scavengers is provided by apex predators, such as wolves, or the natural death of prey . Likewise, at certain times of the year, hunters can provide a significant source of carrion in the form of gut piles. The resource pulse of gut piles that hunters provide generally occurs over a small area and short period of time. This pulse represents a large input of gut piles into the ecosystem from animals that would otherwise not be available to scavengers. Carrion pulses have the potential to reduce predation on prey species by providing a less risky meal for predators. Alternatively, predators that consume carrion may also increase predation pressure on prey populations in the same environment when the carrion pulse is depleted.
Since gut piles are provided by human hunters, the suite of scavengers and time that animals scavenge is likely to differ from carrion left by predators. Mere human presence on the landscape may attract wildlife. For instance, similar to their response to wolf activity, ravens respond positively to the sound of gun shots, because it means easy food. Large carnivores such as gray wolves and bears may also be drawn to hunter gut piles.
Questions
Is there snow?
Snow and cold temperatures can affect the detectability of food resources. Offal piles are no different. We want to know how if there is snow on the ground so we can relate that later to the species that are visiting the offal at that time.
Is it a bird or mammal?
When a highly nutritious food source such as hunter provided offal are abundant on the landscape, different species guilds are often observed at the same food source. For this question, volunteers will be determining if the scavenger species is a bird, mammal, or if both are present at the gut pile.
What species use offal?
Minnesota is unique in that it has four distinct biomes. Each biome supports different vegetation communities, human land use, and consequently, different scavenger species. This question will help us determine the species that are recorded at hunter gut piles across the state."
43;Etch A Cell - Powerhouse Hunt;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/h-spiers/etch-a-cell-powerhouse-hunt/about/research;"Overview of our research – who are we, what are we studying, and why?
The science team behind Etch A Cell are based at the Francis Crick Institute in London, UK. There they work with many other researchers to study different aspects of biology using cutting-edge Electron Microscopes. These microscopes have a very high magnification and resolution, and so can be used to take highly-detailed images of many things, including cells, molecules and tissues. These images can be used to provide us with a richer understanding of biology, which can help us understand the biological changes associated with health and disease.
Recent developments in electron microscopy mean it is possible to collect images automatically, so our team is now producing a huge amount data; looking at a single cell alone can produce several terabytes worth! Although these technological advances mean we can perform our research much faster, this flood of data has caused a data analysis bottleneck, which is why we need your help!
 

In this project you'll get to see some very high resolution images of cells like this one!
  How you can help – colour in cells for science!
To make sense of the images taken by the electron microscope we must carefully analyse them. To extract meaning from the images we segment the features we’re interested in, which means to draw around the bits of the cell that we want to study. We need your help with this task – to colour in different parts of the cell. In this second Etch A Cell project, the cellular feature we would like you to help us segment are the mitochondria.
 



In this project we need you to spot and draw around mitochondria like these ones (for more examples, see our mitochondria gallery on the Field Guide tab on the right hand side of your screen)
  Mitochondria – the powerhouses of your cells
Mitochondria are a type of organelle (a small, specialized structure) found within eukaryotic cells. They are often referred to as the ‘powerhouses’ of the cell as they convert fat, protein and sugar from food into chemical energy. In addition to the production of energy, mitochondria also contribute to other critical biological processes, including the regulation of cell growth and cell death. It is because of their role in a variety of cellular functions that the malfunction of mitochondria is associated with a range of different diseases, which makes them a particularly important organelle to study. Most cells within your body contain mitochondria, but they can vary in number, size, structure and position. In this project, we ask you to simply draw around each mitochondria you see in each image. This effort will help significantly improve our understanding of mitochondrial biology.
  Why do we need your help?
The process of manual segmentation can take a really long time - it is the major bottleneck in our research - this is why we need your help! While it may look as though computers would be able to perform this process very well already, in practice they are still quite error-prone and the time it takes to perfect the algorithm can be longer than the time to do the segmentations by hand. Small variations in the images, either due to real biological differences or due to slightly different imaging conditions, often render a finely-tuned algorithm ineffective for other data, sometimes meaning that the algorithms need to be optimised for each and every sample!
We hope that this project will advance our ability to analyse biological features using electron microscopy and segmentation. With enough volunteer help we may be able to train computers to segment automatically; this has huge potential to help us understand biology and study disease!

The Measuring the ANZACs project brings together an international team of researchers, community connections around New Zealand’s military history from the Auckland War Memorial Museum, and the power of the Zooniverse community to explore, analyze, and digitize original World War I personnel files from Archives New Zealand.
Data gathered from Measuring the ANZACs will be used for three main purposes:
To create a complete and rich index of persons who served in the New Zealand military in World War I and the South African War (also called the Second Boer War).
To support academic research on the health of New Zealanders led by a team of researchers at the Universities of Minnesota, Guelph and Waikato.
To provide an ongoing platform for historical and genealogical research on NZ’s World War I soldiers by citizens and scientists around the world.
Measuring the ANZACs builds on work done by Archives New Zealand to complete an organized digital collection of all the pages in the personnel files for people serving in the New Zealand military in South Africa and World War I. Complete copies of personnel files are available on this website, the Archives New Zealand website, and Discovering the ANZACs. They can be downloaded free of charge on the Archives New Zealand website.
All of the data collected by Measuring the ANZACs will be made freely available to the public for research. Periodic releases of the data will be released throughout the life of the project by the University of Minnesota and the Auckland War Memorial Museum. Researchers interested in data updates and discussing the extensive possibilities of research with the data are encouraged to contact the research team by email or on the Discourse discussion boards. When records have been created for all who served, complete open-sourced copies of the data will be available through the University of Minnesota, Archives New Zealand and the Auckland War Memorial Museum’s Online Cenotaph.
PERSONNEL FILES
Personnel files provide a thorough description of an individual’s military service from enlistment, through wartime, and beyond. The archival copies of personnel files reflect their working origins in multiple locations and compilation into one file at various points during and after the war. Thus, the order of documents within the files varies; a key part of this project is identifying what documents are present for any given individual.
KEY TYPES OF DOCUMENTS WITHIN THE FILES INCLUDE:
Attestation Papers: Filled out at enlistment, these documents provide a rich description of an individual when he (and sometimes she) entered the military, recording their identity, social and economic status, next of kin, and health information. They also fulfil a legal purpose wherein the individual swears they will serve in the military and follow orders.
History Sheets: These papers record the major events in an individual’s military service, including embarkation from New Zealand, service in various theatres of war, wounds, sickness, capture and release as a prisoner of war, and death during the war.
Death Notifications: Created after the war, these papers were sent from the central office to the military to inform them of a returned New Zealand veteran’s death.
Archives New Zealand has digitized all of the pages in the personnel files, and we know the names of the individuals in a file and their serial number. Beyond that, we know little about the content of an individual file, and even what types of documents are present in the files.

45;Galaxy Zoo: Clump Scout;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/hughdickinson/galaxy-zoo-clump-scout/about/research;"In the nearby Universe, most galaxies can be categorized as spirals, ellipticals, or irregular systems. However, in the more distant (and younger) Universe, galaxy shapes were more diverse and galaxies with ""clumpy"" structures dominate. Galaxies of the past went through a period of intense star formation which is thought to be largely responsible for these unusual shapes. This period of star formation has since died off and most galaxies today have settled down into the types we see in the local Universe. That is to say, ""clumpy"" galaxies weren't thought to exist in large numbers today.
Distant clumpy galaxies (from Hubble)
The above image shows a sample of these distant clumpy galaxies classified during the Galaxy Zoo: Hubble (GZH) project. That project also included a small sample of images from the Galaxy Zoo 2 project which focused on nearby galaxies. It turns out that dozens of ""clumpy"" galaxies were discovered in our own cosmic backyard! (shown below)
Nearby clumpy galaxies (from Sloan Digital Sky Survey)
The similarities are remarkable, and this is exciting because it's much easier to study nearby galaxies than distant ones. If we can find more clumpy galaxies close to us, it could help us understand the distant clumpy galaxies and, subsequently, the period of ferocious star formation of the past.
One outstanding mystery is that we don't fully understand how clumps form. It could be due to mergers between galaxies, or due to instabilities within the galaxy itself that cause large clouds of gas to collapse and rapidly form stars. We also don't fully understand what happens to the clumps over time. Some models predict that these large clumps eventually migrate to the center of the galaxy to form the galactic bulge. Other models suggest that these clumps are short lived and dissipate before they can migrate to the center. Determining which scenario is correct could have dramatic implications about the formation and evolution of disk galaxies.
We asked the ""clumpy"" question in the Galaxy Zoo: Hubble and Galaxy Zoo: CANDELS projects because we knew that this type of galaxy would be plentiful in the distant Universe. But since the discovery of dozens of these galaxies in the local Universe we've decided that we need to reconsider the Galaxy Zoo 2 project which never asked the ""clumpy"" question. In this project, we're asking you to take a second look at a portion of the original Galaxy Zoo 2 images that volunteers strongly classified as having features and asking if you see any clumps in these nearby galaxies.
As always, we couldn't do it without you!"
46;NestCams;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/spotteron/nestcams/about/research;"NestCams is a project of the Konrad Lorenz Research Center (a Core Facility of the University of Vienna, Austria), which is located in Grünau in the Almtal in Upper Austria.
Video monitoring of nests is part of a broader project into the breeding performance of two avian model species, the greylag goose that forms long-term monogamous pairs and the northern bald ibis that is seasonally monogamous. The research is funded by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG). A key objective of the NestCams project is to involve citizens in the collection of behavioural data, with participation from local to international citizen scientists.
We are interested in measuring the breeding performance of greylag geese and northern bald ibis. From previous studies we know that some pair partners are repeatedly successful parents whereas others are not. Reproductive success is calculated from the number of offspring that survive to fledge. However, the number of chicks that fledge may be different from the number of eggs that hatch. Adding to this complexity is the issue of adoption as some greylag geese adopt lost goslings. By observing the behaviour of the birds across the breeding period (egg laying, incubation, chick rearing) we aim to discover which behavioural patterns contribute to reproductive success. For this purpose, we equipped a number of breeding facilities with video-cameras that record the behaviour of the breeding birds. In geese, the breeding huts are located on water; in ibis the camera is installed in nest-niches in an open-air aviary.
Join us and help us code the video material collected in spring 2018!

Both avian model species live on the grounds of the Konrad Lorenz Research Center. The greylag geese are part of a non-migratory flock; they are semi-tame, unrestrained and free-flying. The northern bald ibis are free-flying. Both species are habituated to the close presence of humans, which allows behavioural observations and long-term monitoring."

Researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz are interested in tracking the number of animals that haul out onto the island's beaches. To study when and where the animals haul out, researchers took drone photos of the island about every two weeks for the past four years.
Although the island is small, thousands of animals can inhabit it at a time, which is where citizen scientists like you come in! We need your help to count each individual animal on a given day. We have divided the drone photos into small sections - some sections may be full of animals, and some may be empty. By helping us classify these photos, you can be part of a collaborative project to better understand how many seals, sea lions, and birds are on Año Nuevo Island during different times of the year, and how the population sizes fluctuate between years. This information can provide important insight into the health of different pinniped and bird populations as well as emphasize the importance of continued protection of Año Nuevo Island and the surrounding areas in Monterey Bay.
This project will potentially allow researchers to investigate three important topics:
The effectiveness of citizen science in simple but large-scale data analysis.
A comparison of the success of censuses from the ground versus aerial photographs.
Investigation of the changes of seal, sea lion, and bird populations in recent years.
Thank you for volunteering your time as a citizen scientist to help us with this important project!

Drones offer a unique perspective
Many researchers have traveled out to Año Nuevo Island to census the animals there, but with at least 3,000 very active animals to count at any given time, this can be extremely difficult. That's why drones are an invaluable tool for animal censuses.
Since the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 prohibits the disturbance of marine mammals, and drone use is prohibited within State Parks, our research team needed special permissions to obtain these photographs. After receiving permission to fly a drone within the State Parks and over water in the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, we were careful not to disturb the animals on the island by flying the drone high in the air. As you can see by the many sleeping sea lions in the photos, the researchers were successful in capturing photos without altering the animals' behavior.

Researchers can utilize herbarium specimen data to model current and future distributions of rare and endemic species. Conservation management in the face of climate change requires new strategies; previously suitable natural habitat may become uninhabitable even if preserved as a conservation easement or biological reserve. In addition, herbaria can be one of the most efficient places to search for new species.
We believe it is critically important to expose data in small and mid-sized collections, with potentially unique specimens and certainly less well-studied specimens than large collections."

51;Chimp&See;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/sassydumbledore/chimp-and-see/about/research;"Can chimpanzee behavior tell us more about the origins of humanity?
Studies of human evolution often focus on the fossils and artifacts left by our early ancestors. However, we can also make inferences about human origins by studying our closest living relatives: chimpanzees, the great apes that live across equatorial Africa. Because humans and chimps are so closely related, patterns in chimpanzee behavior may tell us quite a bit about how the earliest hominids lived and evolved.
Many theories tie human evolution to meat-eating and tool use.
It is thought that a major leap in the mental, physical, and cultural development of Homo sapiens was associated with increases in hunting, meat-eating, and the use of tools. We sometimes see similar human-like behaviors appear among diverse populations of today’s wild chimpanzees. If we study when, where, and how such behavior is more prominent, we can get a better idea of the evolutionary scenarios that led to the rise of our species.
You can watch videos to help us learn about chimps and humans.
For this project, we have collected nearly 7,000 hours of footage, reflecting various chimpanzee habitats, from camera traps in 15 countries across Africa. (We are also collecting a wide variety of organic samples from these sites, such as feces, hair, and plant matter, and information on the ecology and environment of each habitat.) By scanning the videos from these traps and identifying the types of species and activity that you see, you’ll help us to understand the lives of these apes—their behaviors, relationships, and environments—and to extrapolate new ideas about human origins.
We have two goals: to learn and to preserve.
In addition to helping us better understand cultural evolution, this project will also document wildlife populations and biodiversity in these areas. Already we have both documented new chimpanzee behaviors and made some startling finds of animals in locations where they were no longer thought to live! We hope that drawing attention to a great many of these sites will incite conservation organizations to take an interest in these areas and move to protect them."
52;Rodent Little Brother: Secret Lives of Mice;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/r-dot-bains/rodent-little-brother-secret-lives-of-mice/about/research;"Despite looking very different to mice, our biology is very similar to theirs. Approximately 99% of human genes are predicted to have an equivalent gene in mice, this close genetic similarity means that mice are widely used in genetics research. Mice also have a short gestation time of about three weeks.
Humans have around 20,000 genes and the function of many of these genes is still unknown. What we do know is that many diseases occur when there is an error in a gene. In fact, most diseases have a genetic cause.
Biologists have developed techniques which allow genetic changes to be made in mice. By investigating the consequences of these changes, we can find out more about the underlying processes taking place when a gene goes wrong.
How mice are studied in medical research
Mice are sociable animals and in a laboratory setting they are housed in small groups where they carry out their daily activities such as eating, sleeping, drinking and grooming. In these ‘home-cages’ they can interact with each other and often have their own social hierarchies.
When researchers make genetic changes to mice, they then observe them to understand the implications of the changes. By using different behavioural tests, they try to diagnose the consequences of the genetic alterations. This usually involves taking the mouse out of the cage and putting it into an unfamiliar environment, which can be stressful for the mouse.
The mice are often also observed most during the day, however as nocturnal animals they’re most active at night time, therefore a lot of important data is missed.
The Home Cage Analysis system
Scientists who work with animals are continually striving to refine the way they are studied to advance the welfare of the animals and the quality of the information collected.
As part of the NC3Rs’ CRACK IT initiative to develop a novel system for studying the behaviour of mice in their home-cage, scientists at MRC Harwell have worked with Actual Analytics in Edinburgh to develop the Home Cage Analysis system (HCA).
This system can track the movements of three individual mice without removing the mice from their social group. This method of studying mice is minimally invasive, and only requires insertion of a microchip in a similar way to microchipping a pet cat or dog. The cage is then placed in the Home Cage Analysis System.
Benefits of the project
This system allows mice to be observed undisturbed in their home-cages with other mice. This offers many welfare benefits for how they are looked after including being able to view the mice in the dark (when they are active).
Studying mice in this way also improves the quality of the science. The ability to define early disease characteristics in the home-cage environment will provide us with vital information on the early stages of diseases and potentially how to treat them. Collecting much more data on each individual animal will reduce variation in each experiment and increase the statistical power of testing, so that less animals need to be used.
This project provides an opportunity to gain new knowledge about how mice behave, particularly in the night when they are most active and over much longer periods of time (months and years), which would have been missed if traditional tests were used. It is also possible to observe social interactions in much more detail than was previously possible.
And all the while the mice are going about their daily business, without any human intervention!
We need your help!
""People are great at recognising behaviours in videos, something that is very hard for computers to do. However using lots of examples from people and combining these with techniques called machine learning we can effectively train computers to recognise behaviours from video. Basically they can learn how to do that task automatically by looking at your examples.""- Prof. J. Douglas Armstrong,School of Informatics, Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation. University of Edinburgh.
Collecting data 24/7 is great, but analysing it all is not easy. We aim to use new computer learning algorithms, just as Prof Armstrong has described, to do the work for us. However, for these algorithms to 'learn' what different mouse behaviours are, they first need to be 'taught'. This is done by feeding it examples of such behaviours, these examples are clips of videos that have been labelled by people manually, just like you would be doing in this project.
For the past four years we have had a team of five people doing just that, and have managed to teach an algorithm to recognise when a mouse is climbing.
Now imagine what we could achieve with all of you helping us!

Getting involved is an opportunity to help with a project that has the potential to change the way mice and other animals are studied in the laboratory.
This will ultimately help advance our understanding of diseases and aid the future development of new therapies and treatments.

53;Galaxy Zoo Mobile;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/mikewalmsley/galaxy-zoo-mobile/about/research;"The Science behind the Site
Welcome to Galaxy Zoo's latest incarnation. For more than a decade, we've asked volunteers to help us explore galaxies near and far, sampling a fraction of the roughly one hundred billion that are scattered throughout the observable Universe. Each one of the systems, containing billions of stars, has had a unique life, interacting with its surroundings and with other galaxies in many different ways; the aim of the Galaxy Zoo team is to try and understand these processes, and to work out what galaxies can tell us about the past, present and future of the Universe as a whole.
Our strategy is based on the remarkable fact that you can tell a lot about a galaxy just from its shape. Find a system with spiral arms, for example, and normally - but critically not always - you'll know that you're looking at a rotating disk of stars, dust and gas with plenty of fuel for future star formation. Find one of the big balls of stars we call ellipticals, however, and you're probably looking at a more mature system, one which long ago finished forming stars. The galaxies' histories are also revealed; that elliptical is likely to be the product of a head-on collision between two smaller galaxies, and smaller features such as warped disks, large bulges or long streams of stars bear testament to the complexity of these galaxies' lives.
Internal changes - what astronomers sometimes call 'secular' processes - can make a difference too. Each large galaxy has at its heart a massive black hole, and there is growing evidence that as matter falls towards these central black holes, it can have a dramatic effect on its surroundings; the matter is heated to enormous temperatures, glowing brightly in high-energy parts of the electromagnetic spectrum such as the x-ray. There might also be powerful jets of material launched from close to the black hole (though not, of course, from the black hole itself) at close to the speed of light. The combination of these jets and the effect of the radiation sometimes heats or expels gas from the galaxy, preventing - for a time, at least - further star formation.
A galaxy's surroundings matter too. At the centre of the Virgo cluster, our nearest large group of galaxies, mergers between systems are rare - held by the cluster's powerful gravitational grip, galaxies are moving too fast for more than brief encounters. In the emptiest parts of space, the density of galaxies is just too low for mergers to play a significant role, and so it's only on the outskirts of clusters or in small groups like our own Local Group that mergers currently play a significant part. It should come as no surprise, then, that we find different types of galaxies in different places, and this too must be taken into account.
Disentangling these effects, and many more, requires the largest possible samples of classified galaxies. It's not uncommon for us to need, for example, a large sample of red, barred, spiral galaxies that reside on the edges of clusters, and if we don't have a large sample to begin with there will be none left when we've narrowed the search. Modern surveys provide enough images - hundreds of thousands upon hundreds of thousands of them - but we still need people to sort them out by shape. That's where Galaxy Zoo comes in.
You can read much more about the scientific adventures Galaxy Zoo has already had on our blog, or in the papers we've written which are listed at Zooniverse.org/publications.
Where do the images come from?
Our latest galaxy images come from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS). Because it uses a larger telescope, DECaLS is 10 times more sensitive to light than the survey that supplied images to the first iteration of Galaxy Zoo, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. That means that we can see more detail.
DECaLS is observing from the Victor Blanco 4 meter (13 feet) telescope in Chile. Check out this livestream from the observatory, including a view straight up the telescope. You can also browse the sky as imaged by DECaLS.
We also have a few images remaining from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. By classifying these galaxies, you're helping scientists working on the MaNGA project compare how the shape of a galaxy affects the light spectra we see.
What's this 'Enhanced' mode all about?
In an effort to speed up classifications to cope with the large number of galaxies we expect to receive from new surveys, we've been working on ways to combine your classifications with those of machines, inspired by the idea that the combination of both automatic and human classification may be more powerful than either alone. If you choose the 'Enhanced' work flow, you will be much more likely to see the top 100 galaxies our galaxy-classifying robot thinks it needs help with in order to improve. All galaxies will be seen by at least a few volunteers to make sure we aren't missing anything. If you'd rather just see a random selection of available galaxies, choose 'Classic’."
54;Skink Spotter NZ;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/jovirens/skink-spotter-nz/about/research;"Skink Spotter
Our project aims to understand how wind, temperature and cloud cover interact to affect the activity of one of Aotearoa New Zealand's largest skinks - the Otago skink. To do this, we need to know when the skinks are active! But to capture activity (or not) during a wide variety of weather conditions we needed to monitor skinks for a relatively long time. We have remotely monitored a site that is home to a population of Otago skinks over several months, using time-lapse cameras taking one photo every minute. Do to the huge number of photos we now have to process we're asking for your help to spot the skinks!
Once we know the weather conditions that allow skinks to be active, we can use future climate projections to estimate how skink activity will change over the next few decades and whether this change will make them more vulnerable to extinction.
This project has been made possible through funding from the Miss E. L. Hellaby Indigenous Grasslands Research Trust, the J.S. Watson Grant (the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society of New Zealand), and the Department of Zoology at the University of Otago. We are also grateful for the support of the New Zealand Department of Conservation and Kāti Huirapa Rūnaka ki Puketeraki (local Māori guardians).
Otago skinks (Oligosoma otagense)
Our work currently focuses on the Otago skink, one of the largest lizards in New Zealand occurring in only two isolated regions of Otago in southern New Zealand. Until recently numbers of Otago skinks were in decline and the species was listed as nationally critically endangered. Recent recovery efforts, including predator-proof fenced habitats and year-round control of introduced predators such as cats, stoats and ferrets at some sites has led to stabilization of the population and the species has been downlisted to nationally endangered. However Otago skinks remain threatened and it is important that we determine how climate change will affect them to help ensure their future survival.
Climate change and skinks in New Zealand
Our broader research aims to find out how climate change will affect New Zealand's skinks. Skinks are a diverse group of lizards, with over 1500 species worldwide. For such a temperate collection of islands, New Zealand has an astounding diversity of skinks - 61 species- all of which are in the genus Oligosoma. Unfortunately many of these species are endangered as they are threatened by introduced predators and habitat loss.
The climate crisis is threatening the survival of lizards worldwide, including skinks. It's well known that lizards like to be warm, but like us they have their limits. If their body temperature becomes too warm they have to find shelter to cool down or risk overheating. If the weather is warmer more often, lizards will have to spend more time hidden away in retreats to stay cool, which means they have less time for activities such as finding food or defending territories. This is known as 'increased hours of restricted activity' and is especially relevant to lizards that live in warmer parts of the world.
In New Zealand, skinks are well adapted for cooler climates, with some species living all the way up into the mountainous alpine areas. Skinks in these areas warm up by basking in the sun, but on cloudy, windy days it's much more difficult for them to get warm and instead they'll stay hidden away under rocks. At the moment, it seems that skink activity restricted by temperatures that are too cool for activity, so how will they be affected by climate change? Will they be more active than they are now if the weather warms up in the future?
Although air temperature is predicted to increase, the number of windy and cloudy days per year are also predicted to increase. This means that skinks might be even colder than they were. We want to work out exactly how air temperature, wind and clouds work together to affect how warm skinks can get, and how often they can be active, so that we can predict how they will be affected by the weather of the future."
55;Wildwatch Burrowing Owl;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/sandiegozooglobal/wildwatch-burrowing-owl/about/research;"Digging Into Burrowing Owl Conservation
The western burrowing owl Athene cunciularia hypugaea in San Diego County is at risk of going locally extinct. To help reverse the decline, San Diego Zoo Global’s Burrowing Owl Recovery Program is working with partners on a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach to address burrowing owl ecology and conservation practices in Southern California. These efforts include reengineering habitat to make it suitable for burrowing owl colonization through providing artificial burrows that mimic natural burrows, as well as adding California ground squirrels to the landscape, which dig burrows the owls can “reuse”. Many burrowing owls have been banded for identification purposes, while some owls get tiny solar-powered GPS telemetry “backpacks” so researchers can track them over time.
One of the best ways to understand burrowing owl ecology (reproductive rates, nest success, survivorship, prey provisioning, and predation) is by setting up motion-activated field cameras outside burrowing owl dens to observe the birds’ behaviors. To give observers a clear context of the behavior, the cameras fire off three images per activation.
Burrow In
That’s where our team of citizen scientists comes in—you can help us classify burrowing owl photos, noting how many birds, ages (adult, juvenile, or fluffy chicks), activity (eating, mating, other), and prey items (as fierce little hunters, it could be anything from a grasshopper to a snake!). Other possible situations you may encounter include copulation (i.e. mating), the burrowing owls being eaten by predator species, or, on rare occasions an owl eating its young (infanticide) or its own sibling (siblicide). There may also be “visitors” at the burrow, like road runners, coyotes, or rabbits. You get to classify and decide!
The first set of images will feature “the Gold family”, a group of 2 banded adult burrowing owls and their 6 chicks that emerged from the burrow. We would like to classify 200,000 photos of this group taken during the 2018 breeding season. Each trio of images will be reviewed by 10 volunteer citizen scientists before it is “retired” from the set to ensure accuracy.
They Grow Up So Fast!
The juveniles, which we often refer to as chicks, go through a few different stages of development. When burrowing owl chicks first hatch (from eggs a little smaller than ping pong balls), they are tiny and pink with white down and closed eyes. Around 5 days of age, their eyes open and they start making a defensive vocalization that sounds like a rattlesnake rattling (it is very convincing). The chicks don’t emerge from the burrow until they are about 2 weeks old. At this point, they are gray with white down and haven’t quite grown into their beaks yet; they don’t venture far from the safety of the burrow entrance. But they grow quickly (in appearance and confidence) into the “fluffy and buffy” stage when they look like comical little pantaloon-wearing butterballs (with antics to match). The chicks practice flying (what we call helicoptering) and pouncing (on sticks, bugs, each other), and finally fledge at 41-45 days of age. They are considered to be fledged when they can sustain flight, but they benefit from a pretty long transition period to independence when they still take advantage of mom and dad for food, protection, learning important survival skills.
The fledglings retain many hallmarks of their juvenile plumage into the late summer. They slowly grow in the stripey head and breast feathers characteristic of the species, and continue to have a buff stripe on their wings as the summer is winding down. The juveniles can usually be identified from adults until the late summer/early fall molt when all of the adults replace their tattered feathers from the past year and take on a fresh, clean look.
Fun Facts
Here are a couple of fun facts to help you understand what you might see in the photos. First, male and female burrowing owls don’t have different markings or colorations, but you can usually figure out who’s who during the breeding season. Because the male spends all of his time in the sun, his feathers get bleached, while the female spends about 6 weeks almost exclusively in the burrow, which keeps her feathers dark brown. It isn’t always the case, but the female is almost always the darker-looking bird.
Second, at the beginning of the nesting period, the female lays about half of her clutch, then begins incubating while continuing to lay the rest of the eggs (she can lay one egg every 1-2 days). Once the female starts incubating, the eggs begin developing which means the first half of the clutch begins developing before the second half is even laid. This can result in the oldest chicks being up to two weeks older than the youngest, which means you might see some chicks that are much smaller than their burrow-mates.
Project Goals
The goal is to see how many chicks emerge from the burrow, how many fledge (reach 45 days of age), and how predation events impact family groups and the greater population. Our study of population dynamics in Otay Mesa is on-going, and you can help add to our understanding.
Threats from a barrage of predators as well as persistent human development encroaching on the burrowing owl’s native grassland habitat pose significate risks to these populations. The more science-based data researchers have about these endearing animals, the more effective conservation strategies can be implemented by land managers.

George Ranald Macdonald (1891 - 1967) was a farmer and local historian in Canterbury, New Zealand. After retiring he began volunteering at Canterbury Museum. When Museum visitors mentioned there was a need for a biographical dictionary of colonial personalities to help with research, Macdonald volunteered for the project.
Compiled by Macdonald between 1952 and 1964, and comprised of over 12000 index cards with biographical information on over 22000 people, the dictionary took about 12 years to complete. Since then it has been accessed by hundreds of people wanting to know more about nineteenth century Canterbury personalities. The dictionary was considered progressive for its inclusion of people from all strata of society. The information included often goes beyond the basic facts and gives a rare insight into the lives of early residents, the businesses they founded, the institutions they were prominent in and the areas in which they lived.
While a monumental achievement, one of the dictionary’s weak spots has been a lack of information on women and children. Most of the entries are organised by male heads of household with women relegated to the role of wife or daughter. In an effort to make women and children more easily findable, a joint public history project between Canterbury Museum and the University of Canterbury is underway. The aim is to tag all the names mentioned in the dictionary.
The G R Macdonald Dictionary is currently available in its entirety through Canterbury Museum's website. Eventually the additional names transcribed by project volunteers will appear under the Associated Person heading for each index card.
A more detailed biography of Macdonald is available on New Zealand's online encyclopedia Te Ara.

Crime has been central in shaping the history and society of Australia. This project will make a significant contribution to family, local, social and criminal justice history by revealing untold stories about the lives of people who committed crimes in Australia across time. It aims to discover new perspectives on the types of factors that led to individuals ending up in the prison system. In particular, it is hoped that the research will challenge existing ideas about what the label of 'criminal' has historically meant by revealing the diverse nature of the people who spent time in prison.

Transcription of these prison records offers unprecedented opportunities to discover how criminal offending fitted into the wider lives of offenders, as well as illuminating the involvement of individuals in a range of criminal activity from the end of the convict period through to the start of the Second World War. The creation of this dataset will thus bridge gaps between historical knowledge of crime and contemporary criminological research by providing insights into the contexts and patterns of offending across a period that saw significant legal and social developments, including mass migrations, changing technologies, war, economic depressions, the emergence of the narcotics traffic, and the evolution of new forms of punishment.

The Citizen, A Weekly Budget of Passing Events and Police News (Melbourne), 2 June 1877. Courtesy of State Library of Victoria.
The scope of the data to be collected means it will enable almost limitless opportunities for research investigations across a variety of legal and social issues, ranging from how factors such as gender, race, age, class and physical/mental conditions impacted upon historical offending, through to the effect of shifts in sentencing practices on changing trends in criminal offending and reoffending. The scale of the records means that the project will be able to apply criminological concepts and advanced statistical analyses to big data about offending patterns across time. This will be combined with more traditional socio-legal approaches using micro-historical case studies for in-depth analyses of the lives of individual offenders.

The data collected can form the foundation for studies spanning fields as diverse as taxonomy, human health, ecology, conservation, and habitat management. While these records are available in print form (as well as other hard copy formats), the materials upon and within which they are stored are beginning to deteriorate and, because of the collection’s current uncatalogued, undigitized state, it is practically invisible to the the global community.

62;Cedar Creek: Eyes on the Wild;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/forestis/cedar-creek-eyes-on-the-wild/about/research;"What is Cedar Creek?
Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve is a world-famous biological field station located in the midwestern USA. This reserve is within the meeting point of the three largest biomes of North America - tallgrass prairie, eastern deciduous forest and boreal coniferous forest - and is consequentially filled with a diverse array of floristic and faunal diversity. World-renowned scientists have made Cedar Creek their workplace from the beginning: the modern science of ecosystem ecology was conceived here in the 1940s. From the earliest work at Cedar Creek to the most modern experiments today, research has focused on ecology and the services ecosystems provide to the planet and to human society.
Animal Diversity and Behavior
Now, researchers at Cedar Creek are turning their attention to the wildlife. For decades, scientists have rigorously monitored, manipulated, and experimented with the incredible plant diversity within Cedar Creek's grassland and forest ecosystems: carbon has been measured, nitrogen fluxes quantified, seedlings meticulously counted. From this incredible body of work, we have discovered some amazing things about the functioning of the natural world. But - what about the animals?
In addition to being home to dozens of long-term plant and soil biodiversity projects, Cedar Creek is also teeming with animal life. This diverse community of herbivores, predators, and meso-predators interact in complex ways that affect each other and the environment that they live in. Rodents are stealing seeds, deer are chowing down on grasses, and recently, wolves and bison are returning to this ecosystem after decades or centuries of absence. The contributions of these interactions to the structure and functioning of these ecosystems remain under-explored. To better understanding how these animals might affect these ecosystems, researchers have deployed a vast network of trail cameras across the Cedar Creek property. These cameras are triggered by motion and body heat to take pictures whenever wildlife pass in front of them, providing a peek into the “secret lives” of the animal community. Over a hundred cameras have been set up, capturing high resolution data on the movement and activity patterns of over a dozen species, including wolves, foxes, coyotes, deer, turkeys, and more. These data will be combined with Cedar Creek's already comprehensive collection of plant and soil data to study how predators structure ecological communities and ecosystems. You can stay in touch with research news, subprojects, stories and more on our blog!
Special Projects
Wolf Recolonization
The loss of top predators from ecosystems worldwide is one of the most pervasive impacts of humans on nature. Predators can affect the demography and behavior of the prey animals they eat in ways that can cascade down to affect a variety of ecosystem processes, including the productivity and diversity of plant communities and nutrient transfer and availability in soils. In systems where people have removed or extirpated predators, ecological systems can change dramatically. However, we don't know whether restoring predators will restore the rest of ecosystems back into their previous state. There is the potential that loss of predators might have resulted in a critical transition to an alternative type of environment that persists even if predator populations later recover. Whether or not systems change after predator restoration likely depends on the type and strength of interactions between animals and plants in the community, and how much animal behavior and populations are regulated by resources vs. predation. We are studying the unassisted return of wolves to Cedar Creek in order to gain a novel understanding of the mechanisms underlying population, community, and ecosystem dynamics, and to develop frameworks predicting how top predator effects cascade through terrestrial food webs.
Canid Classifier
Multiple types of canids live in Cedar Creek, including wolves, coyotes, and both red and gray foxes. It can get difficult, particularly at night, to distinguish wolves from some of these other canids when lighting in bad or there are no good size references. Because we want to get the best possible data on wolves at Cedar Creek, we ask you to classify any wolf, coyote, or fox images you find as ""wild canids"". Once we reach a critical mass of ""wild canid"" photos, we will open a NEW task dedicating to picking out the little details that help us distinguish these different species of predators!
Trophic Cascades
When predators reduce the number of herbivores in a community by eating some of their population, they indirectly benefit the plant communities that these herbivores would have eaten - that is to say, more predators is better for plants, because it means fewer herbivores eating grasses, trees, and forbs. This is known as a ""trophic cascade"", where the abundance of animals at one trophic level (e.g. predators) trickles down to affect multiple other trophic levels (e.g. prey, producers).
But predators can change far more than just prey numbers - the risk of being eaten can also ""scare"" prey into changing their behavior in ways that could also have ecosystem-wide effects. When predators are around, prey can alter when and where they are active in order to avoid running into dangerous situations. This concentrates prey grazing, browsing, and trampling into certain areas of the landscape and frees up other spaces from herbivore activity. Hypothetically, if these ""fear effects"" were strong enough, this too should alter plant communities - except that the effect only manifests in certain portions of the landscape but not others.
However, we still know very little about the relative strengths of consumptive vs. behavioral effects of predators on prey behavior or even whether behavioral effects are strong enough to cause any changes to plant or soil communities to begin with. We are currently testing the different components of the ""behaviorally-mediated"" trophic cascade hypothesis in the no-wolf areas of Cedar Creek, simulating predator presence using wolf urine to create a fear effect, but removing the consumptive effect of predation. We are using the camera traps to see whether these cues change prey behavior, while simultaneously sampling the plant and soil communities to look for evidence of cascading impacts!"
63;Earthquake Detective;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/vivitang/earthquake-detective/about/research;"Earthquake Detective
The Earth Shakes
Though the ground beneath our feet is stable, it is just a small part of many segments on the Earth's surface. These 'plates' are moving on Earth’s interior like leaves on a lake. When two plates of the Earth collide in an earthquake, they release huge amounts of energy as waves that we feel as shaking. In general, any event that sends waves shaking through the Earth is known as a seismic event, coming from the Greek word seien (to shake).
Seismic Waves on the Earth's Surface
Waves generated from a seismic event spread out in all directions from the event, like rays from the sun. They spread into the Earth and across its surface. Waves on the Earth's surface ('surface waves') have the longest duration and highest displacement of all seismic waves. When they pass through a region which is under seismic stress, surface waves may trigger earthquakes or a tremor in locations far away from the source that generated the waves. Determining the frequency and conditions under which seismic events occur will lead to a better understanding of earthquakes.
Detection and the Data Challenge
Instruments for measuring the motion of the Earth's surface continuously record across the USA and around the globe. These recordings of the seismic waves are known as seismograms, documenting the earthquakes that make the news as well as many, many weaker seismic events. These events may be recorded at just one or multiple instrument locations. The number of available seismograms is staggering! Citizen scientists can provide much needed assistance in classifying these events.
Project Execution and Significance
Scientists (known as seismologists) need your help to classify these events. By listening to seismic waves, different seismic events can be classified by anyone. When enough data is classified, seismologists and data scientists can use it to train a machine learning algorithm (an example of artificial intelligence, or AI) to automate the classification of seismograms. Once enough data is classified, seismic models for how, where, when, and why earthquakes happen can be better tested. The work citizen scientists put into this project contributes to the fundamental understanding of our planet that will allow a more sustainable society by allowing professionals to better assess risk for future seismic events.
Earthquakes
Here are a couple of examples of how earthquakes signals can sound. Remember that earthquakes represent waves from a sudden displacement between two plates or along a fault. The sounds you hear represent the sudden release of acoustic/seismic energy. Some people say it sounds like a slamming door.

Tremor
Tremor is different from earthquakes. Tremor is a term that represents
“rumblings"" from a slow release of acoustic/seismic energy and can sound, for example, like a train darting over train tracks. Here are a couple of examples of how tremor signals can sound.

None of the Above
The Earth is always shaking a little from long-ago or distant seismic events. However, a nearby noise source (for example, a stampede of a passing herd of buffalo) will cause a distinct seismic signal. A loud concert, sports match, meteorite impact, quarry blast, construction site, etc. near a seismic station, for example, can cause weird sounds in the sped-up seismogram that don't sound like an earthquake or a tremor. If a sped-up seismogram sounds like there is/are one or more event signals in it that is or are unclear or unusual, that classification is just as important as identifying an earthquake or tremor. Don't hesitate to label a sound file as 'none of the above'!
Noise
The Earth is always shaking from long-ago events, distant events, atmospheric and oceanic activity, and even nearby steady sources of noise, such as traffic or machinery. In every seismogram that is sped-up to the audible range, there will be random 'noise' which forms an ever-present 'baseline' for the sound file. If there are no other distinct signals, then the seismogram represents just ""noise"". Classifying a sped-up seismogram as just noise is just as important as identifying an earthquake or tremor. Don't hesitate to label a sound file as 'noise'!
Noise sounds like whistling wind, or crinkling tin foil. Here are a couple of examples of how noise signals can sound.

This project is part of a larger collaborative project investigating how genes influence social behavior using rhesus macaque monkeys as a model. These highly social monkeys are excellent models for understanding human social behavior, including individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). What we learn by studying the monkeys can be used to help us understand similar processes in humans. We study the behavior of these monkeys and also collect genetic and other data from the same monkeys. We collected blood to make smears that we can characterize to help us understand monkey health in the population. Since whole blood contains many different types of cells, we need your help to identify the types of cells in the whole blood from each animal. These data will be compared between animals to help us determine the number and kinds of cells in the average monkey in our population, and to then understand which ones are healthy and which may be sick. Next we can compare this blood count information with the behavioral measures on the same monkeys to see how animal health contributes to differences in their behavior.
Rhesus Macaques
Rhesus macaques are Old World monkeys (monkeys that are native to Africa and Asia) and they are much more closely related to humans than mice. Their adult height is around 1.5 feet high and they weigh around 11-17 pounds. They are sexually dimorphic, meaning the males and females have different physical features and characteristics (e.g. different size and weight). These highly social animals form different social groups. Females stay with the social group they were born into, but the males disperse to a new group once they are sexually mature. We study the behavior of individual animals to compare to other metrics of health, such as blood counts.
Cayo Santiago
Cayo Santiago is a small island off the eastern coast of Puerto Rico. A free-ranging population of more than 1,000 rhesus macaques inhabits this 37.5 acre island. Since 1938 when the monkeys were brought to the island from India, scientists have been studying their behavior and, more recently, investigating their genetics to better understand the monkeys and their connection to humans.This primate field site has been under study longer than any other primate field site in the World!
Hurricane Maria caused severe damage to the island of Cayo Santiago where these monkeys live, but this presents an opportunity to understand how natural disasters impact animal (and human) health and behavior.

Social Behavior Collection
Members of our research team collect daily behavioral data on specific animals (called focal animal follows) on the island of Cayo Santiago. The animals are used to humans being on the island so human presence does not seem to impact their behavior. Each animal has a unique ID so the amount of time it spends alone, with other animals, grooming, eating, etc. is recorded. The behavioral information for each animal is then compared to other metrics of health, such as blood counts, to help us understand some of the forces causing differences in their behavior.
Blood Typing
Whole blood is collected from a subset of animals living on Cayo Santiago each year. This blood is used for genetic testing (to extract DNA) and is also used to assess animal health by studying the types and numbers of blood cells. We have developed a pipeline to assess blood smear images from the rhesus macaques on Cayo Santiago. We select animals for which we have genetic and behavioral data and additional blood for other genetic work. Whole blood is smeared across microscope slides and is stained to better distinguish the types of cells in the blood.
This pipeline involves using a microscope to view (or take images of) individual microscope slides with monkey blood. We count the number and types of blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets) in images from individual animals. We next classify the white blood cell types (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes and, rarely, basophils and eosinophils). We assess the animals for: unusual red blood cell shapes (this could signify a specific disease in an animal), unusually low or high numbers of white blood cell types (this could signify an animal with an infection), and high numbers of normally rare white blood cells (this could signify a diseased animal).
Research goals
What will we do with the data and how does this tie into the larger project?
The number and types of blood cells will be compared across all animals in the population to determine the normal range for the monkeys on Cayo Santiago. This will allow us to identify animals that fall outside of this normal range to assess their health and determine any impact on their behavior and reproductive success (number of offspring). We will also compare each animal's genetic information to the blood count information to determine if there are genetic factors that impact their blood cell makeup. These comparisons will be valuable to understand how the differences in blood cell counts and DNA sequence correlate with aspects of their social behavior."

Gunnison Island, located in the remote northern part of Great Salt Lake in Utah is one of the world's largest breeding grounds for American White Pelicans. The pelicans trade food and freshwater for a safe place to rear their young. Pelicans are very susceptible to disturbance from humans and ground-based predators and recent low lake levels have exposed land bridges to this critical nesting ground.
The PELI Project (Project in Education and Longitudinal Investigation of American White Pelicans) began in 2017 to further understand pelicans nesting at Great Salt Lake and the effects of our changing environment on their life history. Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, Tracy Aviary, MesoWest at the University of Utah, and Great Salt Lake Institute at Westminster College combined forces to put 15 PELIcams on the pelican's secluded breeding grounds of Gunnison Island.

66;SuperWASP Variable Stars;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/ajnorton/superwasp-variable-stars/about/research;"SuperWASP Variable Stars
Stars are the building blocks of the Universe and determining stellar parameters is a cornerstone of astrophysics. Variable stars are the key to this, as their time domain signal may be used to probe the dynamics or structure of a stellar system. The first step in such research is to identify and classify samples of variable stars, and that is the purpose of this project.
Classification of periodic variable stars based on the shape of the photometric variability displayed in their folded lightcurves is not always a conclusive way of uniquely determining their type. However, it can at least give a good indication of the possible type and identify candidates that are suitable for follow-up investigations, often involving spectroscopy.
SuperWASP is the Wide Angle Search for Planets, but the results it obtains also comprise a unique data set for exploring stellar variability. The SuperWASP stellar photometry archive is distinctive in two key ways. First, it is an all-sky survey (excluding only the Galactic plane) and so covers a homogenous sample of bright stars. Second, the lightcurves have both high cadence (many observations per night) and long baseline (spanning many years), so can be used to search for variability on all timescales from hours to years.
The purpose of identifying and classifying periodic variable stars in the SuperWASP data is also twofold. The first purpose is to identify large catalogues of objects of a similar type which can then be studied en masse to determine characteristics of the population; and the second purpose is to identify rare objects displaying unusual behaviour, which can offer unique insights into stellar structure and evolution.
Pulsating stars
Some stars exhibit periodic changes in brightness that are due to changes in the star's size and luminosity as its outer layers expand and contract in a regular manner. These so-called pulsating stars come in several varieties. Measurements of stellar pulsations are used to determine parameters of stars such as mass and radius. These deductions are based on stellar models, so large populations of such stars need to be investigated to test the models. Some of the most common types of pulsating star are RR Lyrae stars, Delta Scuti stars, Cepheid variables and Mira variables.
RR Lyrae stars are post main sequence, giant stars sitting on the so-called horizontal branch of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. As such they all have very similar intrinsic luminosity. They have pulsation periods typically around half a day. The RRab subtype have characteristic pulsation profiles with rapid increase in brightness followed by a more gradual decline, whilst in the RRc subtype the profile is less asymmetric. A large (but unknown) proportion of RR Lyrae stars display the so-called Blazhko effect which is an amplitude and/or frequency modulation of the pulse profile with a period of tens or hundreds of days.
Delta Scuti stars are main-sequence stars or sub-giant stars of early spectral type and exhibit pulsation periods of a few hours. Their pulsation profiles are typically saw-tooth in shape with a rapid rise and slower decline.
Cepheid variables are giant or supergiant stars with pulsation periods of days to months, whilst Mira variables are evolved stars on the asymptotic giant branch, and display pulsation periods of more than 100 days, often several years. Like other pulsating stars, the pulsation profiles of these types of star also display a relatively rapid increase in brightness followed by a slower decline.
In this classification project, it is often difficult to distinguish these different types from their folded lightcurves alone, so all types will simply be classified as pulsators.
Eclipsing binary stars
Eclipsing binary stars are systems in which two stars orbit around their common centre of mass. If the system is aligned such that the plane of the orbit is close to our line of sight, each star will pass in front of the other once per orbit, so giving rise to two eclipses per cycle. Eclipsing binary stars are the only systems in which stellar masses and radii can be directed measured by dynamical means.
If the two stars are well separated, eclipses will be relatively narrow and there will be little or no brightness variation outside of the eclipses in these detached binaries. These stars are classified as Algol type eclipsing binaries or EA type for short. The primary and secondary eclipses will generally be V-shaped and of different depths; they will be separated by 0.5 in phase if the orbits are circular, but can be offset from this if the orbits are appreciably elliptical. If the two stars are closer, one may fill its equipotential surface (known as its Roche lobe) and so be distorted into an ellipsoidal shape. In these semi-detached binaries, there can be a smoothly varying brightness outside of the eclipses as the distorted star presents a changing cross-sectional area. The primary and secondary eclipses are again usually of different depths. These stars are classified as Beta Lyrae type eclipsing binaries or EB type for short. In practice there is a continuous distribution from EA type to EB type and it can often be difficult to distinguish between them, so in this project you will classify such objects as EA/EB type.
Here's an excellent diagram from Kang Young-Woon (Journal of Astronomy and Space Sciences Volume 27, Issue2, p75~80, 15 June 2010) which illustrates a range of detached and semi-detached eclipsing binaries.
If the two stars are so close that both fill their Roche lobes, the two stars are in contact. Matter can flow between the stars which will therefore generally be at the same photospheric temperature. The stars will also be tidally locked such that their rotations match the orbital period. The primary and secondary eclipses will generally be of similar, sometimes identical, depth and there is a continuous brightness variation through the orbit. Sometimes one maximum will be brighter than the other, due to the presence of star spots on one of the stars - this is known as the O'Connell effect. Due to the proximity of the stars, their orbits will always be circular, so the two eclipses will be 0.5 apart in phase. These stars are classified as W Ursae Majoris type eclipsing binaries or EW type for short.
Here's an illustration of a contact binary and its associated lightcurve from BotRejectsInc (http://cronodon.com/SpaceTech/AstroTech.html).
Precise measurement of the eclipse times in eclipsing binaries can lead to measurements of how the binary orbital period is changing with time. If the period is increasing, the stars must be getting further apart; if the period is decreasing, the stars must be getting closer together and may eventually merge. If the period increases and decreases in a periodic manner, that may instead be due to a varying light travel time effect and indicate that the binary is itself in orbit with a third star in the system (see ""Results"").
Rotationally modulated stars
Stars displaying rotational modulation may be single stars with significant star spots on their surface. As such stars rotate, their apparent brightness will vary, so giving rise to a continuous, often sinusoidal, variation in brightness. There is a (poorly understood) relationship between a star's rotation period and its activity, so samples of rotational variables can be used to investigate this phenomenon.
Other rotational variables are close binary stars that do not eclipse one another, but are distorted into non-spherical (ellipsoidal) shapes by gravity due to their proximity. As such stars rotate around one another, they present a varying surface area to our line of sight and give rise to so-called ellipsoidal modulation in their folded lightcurves. These stars too will exhibit sinusoidal variations in their folded lightcurves.
In this classification project, both types will simply be referred to as rotators.
Multiply periodic stars
Multiply periodic stars are those which display more than one coherent periodic modulation in their lightcurve. These can include hierarchical multiple stellar systems, where a single point of light actually comprises (for instance) four stars composed of two eclipsing binary systems in orbit around their common centre of mass. The periods of both eclipsing binaries may be present in the lightcurve. We have previously identified the only known doubly eclipsing hierarchical quintuple star (see ""Results"") from SuperWASP data. Such hierarchical multiples can be used to investigate how stars form and evolve.
Another cause may be a pulsating star in an eclipsing binary system such that the lightcurve displays modulation at both a pulsation period and an eclipsing binary period. These systems are important as they allow dynamical stellar masses and radii to be measured and compared with the predictions of stellar pulsation models in the same system. We have previously identified a bright Delta Scuti pulsator in a semi-detached eclipsing binary with one of the largest pulsation amplitudes of any such system known (see ""Results""). Around a hundred or so Delta Scuti stars are known in eclipsing binaries, but there are no known RR Lyrae stars in eclipsing binaries."

The vast nation of South Sudan is characterized primarily by moist savanna and montane forests, with over 280 mammal species historically recorded. These include eastern chimpanzee and 11 other primates, both species of African elephants, multiple felids and other carnivores, and over 100 species of bat. We primarily work in the southwestern corner, a unique tropical forest belt linking the biomes of Central and East Africa. Biodiversity monitoring has been central to our program since 2012. An understanding of the basic fauna and flora of an area is important in interpreting the overall health of an ecosystem and is fundamental to all other efforts, as it drives conservation planning and reserve management.
…but plagued by conflict
Although rich in culture, biodiversity, and resources, South Sudan’s people are among the poorest in the world. Continued conflict has blocked research and conservation for decades, and both people and wildlife continue to suffer greatly from the costs of war. South Sudan is in the fourth year of its current civil war which – like its two previous civil wars – falls along ethnic lines and urban/government versus rural/opposition lines. FFI, in collaboration with Bucknell University, is one of a very small number of wildlife conservation actors continuing to operate on the ground in-country.
Conservation Importance
During the current conflict, poaching as a source of life-sustaining protein has increased as has the opportunity for illegal extraction of natural resources including logging and deforestation. The national authorities for wildlife conservation are incapacitated: funds have been cut, salaries are paid late, and there is no financial allocation for institutional operational costs. In many areas across other parts of the country, Wildlife Service personnel have returned to their military role and are fighting on different sides of the civil war. This is a complex political environment, but FFI and Bucknell are well positioned: previous relationships with government and communities have put them in a neutral position, enabling them to conduct impartial conservation activities, bringing together a variety of actors.
Study Location
Our study area in the dense tropical forests of southwestern South Sudan presents many conservation opportunities. The area’s wilderness, small human footprint, and undeveloped protected areas offer the opportunity for recovery and sustainment of both wildlife and human populations. There exists a latent knowledge of the importance of protecting these natural resources, but for decades nothing concrete had been done about it.
Aiding conservation through biodiversity surveys and community involvement
Extensive camera trapping efforts have yielded ~425,000 images, and efforts continue. Camera traps are a powerful tool both for documenting biodiversity and for estimating abundance and species distributions. They are proving critical to our studies of elephants and chimpanzees and have offered insights on species range expansions and new country records.
The South Sudan Wildlife Service is a key partner, as are nearby communities, who are trained to protect and monitor the cameras as part of a wider project that supports community-led natural resource management. The Wildlife Service and community members have come together in order to develop a model of joint ownership for wildlife conservation. Community members were trained and named Community Wildlife Ambassadors (CWAs). This has maintained collaboration and stability between the government and rural communities in the area where camera traps are deployed, enabling wildlife conservation activities to continue. CWAs support the State Wildlife Service (WLS) in the management of the reserves by conducting regular wildlife patrols and managing camera traps. Rangers are trained and gain literacy, map navigation, and technology skills. Through patrolling, reporting, and using their new navigation and GIS skills, CWAs gather valuable information about the reserve and surrounding area. This information is used to inform patrol plans and aid the monitoring and protection of wildlife. We are also expanding work into human livelihoods, recognizing that poaching and unsustainable resource use increases when people are food insecure.
Our camera trap program is now in its second year. We continue to move the cameras to different areas, and need your help identifying animals in the camera trap photos! Your identifications will help us understand biodiversity, abundance, behavior, and distributions, which will ultimately lead to better conservation planning in this extraordinary environment.

68;Snapshot Hoge Veluwe;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/y-dot-liefting/snapshot-hoge-veluwe/about/research;"De Hoge Veluwe National Park in the Netherlands has a wildlife monitoring system that is unique in the world: a network of dozens of camera traps that continuously monitor the activity of the animals in the Park. The network is unique because of the large quantity of cameras that are placed randomly throughout the the Park, the long time duration that they have been monitoring ánd the fact that the Park is largely fenced, meaning that there is a high level of monitoring possible on the wildlife that is inside.
Every year these cameras provide us with over a million pictures. In the past couple of years we were able to process a quarter of these, with the help of a group of trained volunteers. Through this Snapshot Hoge Veluwe project we want to include you, the public, in this photo analysis process. In this way we hope to get a lot more information out of our already existing camera network. Opening up the database to the public of course has the added benefit that you get to learn about the amazing wildlife in our Park. We love to connect with more nature enthusiasts!
What is being researched and why is this important?
The data that is gathered with the camera network has been used by researchers since 2013 to monitor the behavior of the wildlife in the Park. How many animals are in the Park? How do they make use of the different habitat types, such as heathland, game pastures and forest. How does the presence of the animals affect the plants? When are the animals most active? How do they respond to visitor activity? These and many more questions are at the heart of research that makes use of the network of cameras.
Answering these questions is important because increasing numbers of deer can be found in the Dutch natural areas. These natural areas are also being connected by green bridges and crosswalks for wildlife to counter fragmentation of their habitats. Since 2013, De Hoge Veluwe National Park also has two of such crosswalks that allow deer and other wildlife to move across the roads adjacent to the Park. To measure the effects of the wildlife crossings, we have installed a network of camera traps in 2013. With these images researchers can track which animals have visited which place at which time. It is important to monitor the effects of this increased connectivity, because too much wildlife can also damage the biodiversity in the Park (through grazing, trampling or rooting), or cause problems for traffic and agricultural areas. At the same time, a certain population density of the wildlife is beneficial to the biodiversity in the Park and it is important that visitors are able to spot the animals. Research into the behavior of the animals helps Park managers to make the right management decisions.
Another important question is around the influence of visitors on the wildlife. Before January 2016, visitors were allowed to wander outside of the paths in areas that were not classified as quiet areas. However we noticed that this caused disturbance to the animals, so we changed the policy and now everyone has to stay on the paths. Using data from the camera traps could help us get a better understanding of the effect of this policy change. As you can see, we can really use your help with analyzing all of these pictures!
About Hoge Veluwe National Park
The Hoge Veluwe National Park in some key figures: the Park covers an area of 5.400 hectare, of which 3.200 hectare forest, 2.100 hectare heathland and 60 hectare of drift sand. The Park has 3 entrances: Hoenderloo, Otterlo and Schaarsbergen, of which the Otterlo entrance is the most used. We have some 570.000 visitors yearly, of which 345.000 people also visit the Kröller-Müller Museum which is located inside the Park boundaries. The Park is home to roughly 220 mouflons, 180 red deer, 200 roe deer, 50 wild boars and an unknown amount of fallow deer, but the exact number of animals differs throughout the seasons.

Manatee acoustic communication has not been studied extensively because it has been believed that manatees have a very limited communication system, which acts mainly as a contact call between a mother and calf. This project will investigate the form and function of manatee vocalizations, and it will allow us to learn more about what signals manatees produce, what potential function they might serve, and what differences individual manatee calls have.
The project's overall goal is to analyze the acoustic (and later video) data sets with the help of citizen scientists. Part of this analysis will be used to train a deep learning system to identify and classify manatee calls. This is phase one of the project in which the citizen scientists are asked to identify and count manatee calls.
Florida Manatee
Florida Manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) is a part of lineage of sirenians that are 50 million years old. While there is some evidence of 35 sirenian species existing over this period of time, today we only have four species left that belong to two families (Dugongidae and Trichechidae). Trichechus manatus latirostris is Florida subspecies and is a part of this project. Manatees feed solely on aquatic vegetation and have no natural predators apart from humans. According to the last aerial survey, Florida currently has 6620 manatees. Even though manatees were recently downgraded from Endangered to Threatened status, they face many challenges, as many die from boat related injuries, toxic algae blooms, entanglements, and cold stress.
Manatee Calls
Manatees have good hearing with an overall hearing range between 500 Hz and 38,000 Hz. The range of the vocalizations is between 3 and 20 kHz (Reep & Bonde, 2006). Manatees are very vocal and produce at least several different types of calls (Umeed et al., 2017; Mann et al., 2006). Although it has been proposed that the main function of manatee vocalizations is to serve as the contact calls between a mother and calf (O'shea and Poché Jr, 2006), there is at least some anecdotal evidence that unrelated manatees might also use calls for social purposes. At this stage, we simply ask for your help to determine if there is a manatee call in the sound file and also to count how many calls you hear in the audio file and see on the spectrogram. Once you start working on this project, you will be amazed by the diversity of calls produced, and you'll discover how manatees appear to call back in response to certain calls.Manatees have somewhat unusual calls because many people expect some sort of low frequency grunts based on the manatee’s size, but the actual calls sound more like bird chirps.
Other Sounds
The underwater environment is rarely silent. Since the recordings were made at the Lowry Park Zoo Manatee Hospital and Rehabilitation Center you will hear many other sounds (learn more in the Project Tutorial and the Field Guide ). You will hear the following: mastication (chewing) sounds that could help to identify the feeding events, mechanical sounds from the recording equipment, filter sounds, some other sounds when manatees rub against the underwater hydrophone, and in some cases you will even hear people talking in the manatee exhibit area.
Data Collection Site

The data was collected over a period of several years at the Lowry Park Zoo (now Zoo Tampa at Lowry Park) Manatee Hospital, Tampa, Florida, USA. Zoo's David A. Straz, Jr. Manatee Critical Care Center is one of the most important manatee rehabilitation facilities in Florida. It has been taking care of sick, injured, and orphaned manatees for more than two decades. Over 20 manatees (males and females) were observed and recorded, their ages differed from just few months old to over twenty years old. Our data sets included both video and audio, but phase one of this project will only include audio data.
Update 03/31/2020: A New Freshwater Dataset Added

Image by Jay Dodge. Manatees at Blue Springs in Orange City, FL
We have added a new dataset graciously shared with us by the Sirenian International nonprofit organization. Their mission is to promote the conservation of manatees and dugong populations around the world through research, education, and inter-cultural collaboration. Please check their website here to learn more. These recordings were made in pristine Florida springs in the presence of dozens (even hundreds) of manatees. You will appreciate the amazing soundscape of Florida springs and the protected freshwater manatee habitats free of anthropogenic noise (and also free of snapping shrimp that dominate salt water manatee habitats). There are also some amazing manatee calls there, so make sure to try out this new, exciting workflow.
Project Significance
Manatee acoustic communication has not been studied extensively, and we still do not know the potential function(s) of manatee calls beyond mother and calf contact. Additionally, categorizing calls and later relating them to behavioral states and events could help make a better sense of the data recorded in the future via passive acoustic recorders. Finally, understanding the categories of manatee calls and individual variations could help create a system for tracking manatees via passive acoustic recordings and potentially warn boaters about a manatee presence in the area.
Note: The white scars on this juvenile manatee's back are from a boat propeller.

70;Galaxy Zoo;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zookeeper/galaxy-zoo/about/research;"The Science behind the Site
Welcome to Galaxy Zoo's latest incarnation. For more than a decade, we've asked volunteers to help us explore galaxies near and far, sampling a fraction of the roughly one hundred billion that are scattered throughout the observable Universe. Each one of the systems, containing billions of stars, has had a unique life, interacting with its surroundings and with other galaxies in many different ways; the aim of the Galaxy Zoo team is to try and understand these processes, and to work out what galaxies can tell us about the past, present and future of the Universe as a whole.
Our strategy is based on the remarkable fact that you can tell a lot about a galaxy just from its shape. Find a system with spiral arms, for example, and normally - but critically not always - you'll know that you're looking at a rotating disk of stars, dust and gas with plenty of fuel for future star formation. Find one of the big balls of stars we call ellipticals, however, and you're probably looking at a more mature system, one which long ago finished forming stars. The galaxies' histories are also revealed; that elliptical is likely to be the product of a head-on collision between two smaller galaxies, and smaller features such as warped disks, large bulges or long streams of stars bear testament to the complexity of these galaxies' lives.
Internal changes - what astronomers sometimes call 'secular' processes - can make a difference too. Each large galaxy has at its heart a massive black hole, and there is growing evidence that as matter falls towards these central black holes, it can have a dramatic effect on its surroundings; the matter is heated to enormous temperatures, glowing brightly in high-energy parts of the electromagnetic spectrum such as the x-ray. There might also be powerful jets of material launched from close to the black hole (though not, of course, from the black hole itself) at close to the speed of light. The combination of these jets and the effect of the radiation sometimes heats or expels gas from the galaxy, preventing - for a time, at least - further star formation.
A galaxy's surroundings matter too. At the centre of the Virgo cluster, our nearest large group of galaxies, mergers between systems are rare - held by the cluster's powerful gravitational grip, galaxies are moving too fast for more than brief encounters. In the emptiest parts of space, the density of galaxies is just too low for mergers to play a significant role, and so it's only on the outskirts of clusters or in small groups like our own Local Group that mergers currently play a significant part. It should come as no surprise, then, that we find different types of galaxies in different places, and this too must be taken into account.
Disentangling these effects, and many more, requires the largest possible samples of classified galaxies. It's not uncommon for us to need, for example, a large sample of red, barred, spiral galaxies that reside on the edges of clusters, and if we don't have a large sample to begin with there will be none left when we've narrowed the search. Modern surveys provide enough images - hundreds of thousands upon hundreds of thousands of them - but we still need people to sort them out by shape. That's where Galaxy Zoo comes in.
You can read much more about the scientific adventures Galaxy Zoo has already had on our blog, or in the papers we've written which are listed at Zooniverse.org/publications.
Where do the images come from?
Our latest galaxy images come from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS). Because it uses a larger telescope, DECaLS is 10 times more sensitive to light than the survey that supplied images to the first iteration of Galaxy Zoo, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. That means that we can see more detail.
DECaLS is observing from the Victor Blanco 4 meter (13 feet) telescope in Chile. Check out this livestream from the observatory, including a view straight up the telescope. You can also browse the sky as imaged by DECaLS.
We also have a few images remaining from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. By classifying these galaxies, you're helping scientists working on the MaNGA project compare how the shape of a galaxy affects the light spectra we see.
What's this 'Enhanced' mode all about?
In an effort to speed up classifications to cope with the large number of galaxies we expect to receive from new surveys, we've been working on ways to combine your classifications with those of machines, inspired by the idea that the combination of both automatic and human classification may be more powerful than either alone. If you choose the 'Enhanced' work flow, you will be much more likely to see the top 100 galaxies our galaxy-classifying robot thinks it needs help with in order to improve. All galaxies will be seen by at least a few volunteers to make sure we aren't missing anything. If you'd rather just see a random selection of available galaxies, choose 'Classic’."

Manchester Museum has over 4.5 million objects in its collection, gathered together over the past 200 years. The collections include Botany, Earth Science, Zoology, Ancient Egypt and Sudan, Archaeology, Living Cultures, Entomology, Numismatics and Archery. The labels and objects are a treasure trove of information about our world and the people that live in it. Recording this information is a challenging and time-consuming task. The information about many of these objects only exists on their labels, hidden away in our storerooms.
To fix this we have started a mass digitisation project to make our collection as accessible as possible. We began with our fossil collection and have now been able to make a start with our botany collection.

It is one of the largest and most important botanical collections in Britain, providing a record of the world's flora. A wonderful group of volunteers have photographed many of the microscope slides and we have worked with Zooniverse to get your help to digitise the specimen information.
Why?
By transferring the information about our specimens to an online searchable database researchers, educators and the public will be able to find specimens much more easily. For example, we would be able to track where and when different species occurred, helping us to understand evolution and how species spread across the globe.
How can you help?
The museum only has a small staff and a limited number of volunteers, so cataloguing our whole collection is too great a task for us to tackle alone. We need your help to get the information about our collection into our database so it can be used to help answer fundamental questions about our world and everything that lives in it. Can you help us unlock this information and release our collection's potential?"
72;SCOTUS Notes: Behind the Scenes at Supreme Court Conference;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/scotus-notes-behind-the-scenes-at-supreme-court-conference/about/research;"Statement of Purpose
Unlike members of Congress, U.S. Supreme Court justices cast their votes in complete privacy during weekly conference meetings. Indeed, only justices are allowed in the Chief's conference room when they gather to discuss, deliberate, and make initial decisions on cases. The only record of what has been said, and by whom, is provided by the written notes the justices themselves take during conference. These crucial hand-written documents (left at publicly available archives including the Library of Congress) will reveal the inner workings of the most secretive aspect of the federal government's most secretive institution -- the U.S. Supreme Court.
The transcription will contribute to key research about law and politics as each participant will become a citizen archivist and transcriber, creating materials that will be of use and openly available to scholars interested in law, policy, and decision making in the nation's highest court. Perhaps the most meaningful outcome is that the collaborative will provide public access to documents that will open up the Court in ways not possible to those who cannot access the Library of Congress or travel to law schools around the country. In so doing, they will also provide these insights in a format that will lead to a better understanding of the justices' decision making process on a wide variety of important cases over the past half century.
The purpose of the project is three-fold:
Provide on-line access to a large collection of almost 50,000 pages of Supreme Court conference notes that reside at the Library of Congress, Washington and Lee Law School, and Yale Law School, by digitizing all the notes;
Engage citizen archivists and transcribers to crowdsource transcriptions of the justices' notes with greater efficiency and accuracy than could be done by researchers at participating institutions; and
Facilitate large-scale quantitative analysis based on these notes to demonstrate how justices interact with one another as they make decisions on law and policy in the United States.
We gratefully acknowledge the on-going financial support of our universities as well as the Law and Social Sciences Program of the National Science Foundation for providing the funding needed to collect, organize, and prepare the digital images used for this project (SES-1556270 and SES-1556227)."
73;Calgary Captured;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/calgary-captured/calgary-captured/about/research;"Calgary Captured is made possible by the support of our generous funders: The Calgary Foundation, TD Friends of the Environment, and Alberta Ecotrust. Thank you!
About
Calgary Captured is a multi-year wildlife monitoring program run in partnership with the City of Calgary, Miistakis Institute, Friends of Fish Creek Provincial Park Society, and Weaselhead/Glenmore Park Preservation Society. The program aims to increase knowledge on our urban wildlife to inform development and management decisions, as well as to engage the community to spread awareness of wildlife.
Why?
The City of Calgary declared support for biodiversity conservation when it adopted the Municipal Development Plan in 2009 that contains policies which will shape how Calgary grows and develops over the next 30 to 60 years. The plan specifically recognizes greening the city with the objective to maintain biodiversity and landscape diversity and the integration and connection of ecological networks throughout the city. (Municipal Development Plan, Section 2.64)
In March 2015, Council approved Our BiodiverCity, Calgary’s 10-year biodiversity strategic plan and accompanying Biodiversity Policy. The plan is based on principles for the protection, development and management of Calgary parks and ecosystems in support of biodiversity. Our BiodiverCity aims to provide a framework for The City to foster more resilient, biologically diverse open space and neighbourhoods that support positive outcomes for Calgarians, visitors, wildlife and plant communities. The strategic plan builds on the City of Calgary Biodiversity Report 2014.
In the fall of 2016, The City of Calgary signed the Durban Commitment, becoming the third Canadian city, alongside the City of Edmonton and the City of Montreal to formally join an international program directed by Local Action for Biodiversity, a program representing local governments from across the world to improve biodiversity planning and management. By signing this commitment, The City acknowledges “accountability and responsibility for the health and wellbeing of our communities through protecting, sustainably utilizing and managing biodiversity and recognizing its role as the foundation of our existence.”
The City of Calgary, Urban Conservation have recognized an important data gap – we need to know where wildlife occur in the city to begin expanding our knowledge and understanding of local biodiversity to meet commitments outlined in the BiodiverCity Strategy and the Municipal Development Plan. To assess the terrestrial mammal diversity of Calgary we are undertaking a multi-year wildlife monitoring program in the city using motion activated remote cameras.
We need a more complete picture of how our wild neighbors are making use of our natural areas and patterns of wildlife presence across Calgary. Knowing where our wild neighbors are will inform conservation and management decisions about our open spaces and better manage human-wildlife conflict.
Some of the questions we will be exploring over the next few years:
What species are occurring in Calgary’s parks system;
Exploration of how human activities impact wildlife movement in parks (are species temporally displaced from trails);
Validation of wildlife corridor modeling done for Calgary; and
Long-term monitoring to assess trends and patterns of terrestrial mammals occurring in Calgary.
Who calls Calgary home?
Calgary supports a population of 1.2 million people but is also home to a diverse array of terrestrial mammals, including bobcat, moose, deer, coyote and skunks. There are occasional reports of black bears and cougars as well. While we can't directly measure populations with the data from our cameras, we can get a sense of which species are most common and where they are likeliest to be found. Finding out where certain species occur allows us to target future conservation and management efforts to ensure we can coexist with our wild neighbors.
How can humans and wildlife co-exist in a city?
People change the way wildlife use the landscape, but specific details remain unclear. Some species adapt well to humans, some are indifferent, and others tend to avoid us. By collecting incidental observation data on humans (what time of day do we use our parks etc) we can get a sense of how animals in urban settings react to humans. Humans are an integral part of the system, and the camera data will allow us to better understand our impact and inform co-existence strategies.
Why Cameras?
Our research includes a network of 63 motion-activated trail cameras, which automatically take photos of animals as they pass by. Camera technology gives us the ability to have many “eyes on the ground” and give us the opportunity to gather large amounts of data that would not be otherwise feasible with traditional field research methods. By establishing a camera network in parks throughout the City of Calgary, we hope to develop a more complete picture of our wild neighbors.
We Need You!
Calgary Captured enables you to join our team and help us classify trail camera photos by identifying the animals you see. By participating not only will you help us with the massive and very important task of identifying wildlife, you get a first hand look into who calls Calgary home and we hope you will enjoy looking at the diversity of wildlife in Calgary. We will use the results to better understand Calgary’s wild neighbors and to help inform our conservation and management goals within the City of Calgary."
74;Snapshot Serengeti;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/snapshot-serengeti/about/research;"The Serengeti Lion Project
The camera trapping survey is operated by the long-term Serengeti Lion Project. The Lion Project has been studying African lions in Tanzania’s Serengeti National Park and the Ngorongoro Conservation Area since the 1960’s. At any given time, our field teams keep track of about 330 lions in 24 prides in the Serengeti, and 50–60 lions in 5 prides on the floor of Ngorongoro Crater. This daily monitoring has produced one of the most extensive datasets on any mammalian species anywhere in the world - over 5,000 lions have been included in the Serengeti and Crater studies over the past 40+ years, and genealogical data from these two populations extend over 12 generations. The daily records include information on the lions’ location, group size, diet, food intake, health and reproduction. You can find out more on the Lion Project website.
Observing animals in the wild
Over the last 45 years, the University of Minnesota Lion Project has discovered a lot about lions – everything from why they have manes to why they live in groups. Now we’re turning our sights to understanding how an entire community of large animals interacts. We currently monitor 24 lion prides in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, using radio-tracking. To collect information about other species, we’ve set out a grid of 225 camera traps. With photographs from these cameras, we’re able to study how over 30 species are distributed across the landscape – and how they interact with lions and one another.
Our scientific questions
Understanding how competing species coexist is a fundamental theme in ecology, with important implications for food webs, biodiversity, and the sustainability of life on Earth. Much of our current research focuses on how carnivores coexist with carnivores, herbivores with herbivores, and the joint dynamics of predators and their prey. These insights will guide strategies for species reintroduction, conservation, and ecosystem management around the world.
Carnivore Coexistence: Carnivores eat meat. If two carnivore species eat the same prey, one of those species can outcompete the other, preventing coexistence of both species in the same area. Even where carnivores don’t compete for the exact same prey, aggressive interactions such as scavenging from and killing each other can prevent coexistence. Research in other parts of the world suggests that when one species avoids the other, the two species might be able to coexist, but coexistence may depend on the structure and complexity of the habitat. Our cameras reveal whether lions, leopards, cheetah and hyenas avoid each other in space or in time and the extent to which this varies across the landscape.
Herbivore Coexistence: Herbivores eat plants. The Serengeti supports sixteen different species of hoofed herbivores. Although these species don’t kill or steal food from each other, we still don’t really understand how they all manage to coexist in this system. Herbivores that are able to feed most efficiently may also be more likely to be killed by predators, and this could explain some of the coexistence. Another possibility is that different herbivores may specialize on different habitat areas. We are using the camera traps to investigate these ideas, as well as study how the annual migration of 1.5 million wildebeest and zebra through our study area affects changes these dynamics.
Predator Prey Relationships: Recent advances in ecology have suggested that there may be costs to herbivores when they avoid predators. For example, if predators hunt in areas with the best plants, herbivores may avoid those areas and only be able to eat plants that aren’t as good. We are using the camera trap data on herbivore distributions to study whether herbivores are found where the best food is or where the risk of being killed by predators is lowest.
What we do
We check on the camera traps in the course of daily lion monitoring. We change batteries, exchange the SD cards, and cut tall grass in front of the camera so that grass waving in the wind doesn’t accidentally trigger the sensor. 225 cameras are a lot of work! When things run smoothly, a camera can last about two months before needing maintenance. But that’s not always the case – sometimes we return to a camera only to find it chewed on by hyenas or torn down by elephants, waterlogged from a heavy rain or infested by ants.
How the cameras work
The cameras use passive infrared sensors that are triggered when an object warmer than the ambient temperature moves in front of the sensor. This is usually an animal…but tall sunlit grass can also trigger the camera when it blows in the wind. We currently use the Scoutguard 565 and DLC Covert Reveal models – these are incandescent flash cameras (with a white flash). Some people worry that incandescent flashes startle the animals, but in our study area the same individuals often come back to the same camera site night after night!

75;Project Plumage;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/ghthomas/project-plumage/about/research;"Help us measure the spectacular diversity of bird colouration
With approximately 10,000 living species, birds are one of the most diverse groups of animals on earth. One characteristic that makes birds so fascinating is their spectacular colouration. From the striking iridescence of hummingbirds to the vibrant colours of macaws, birds have evolved an astounding diversity of colours and patterns.
In addition to the colours that we can see, many bird species can also perceive light in the ultraviolet (UV) range of the spectrum. The discovery that many birds see and respond to UV colouration has had a significant impact on how researchers now measure bird plumage colouration, as well as on our understanding of how birds see each other.
Our team is hoping to measure the dazzling array of plumage colouration in birds to gain a better understanding of how and why spectacular animal colouration evolves. Some of the key questions we hope to answer are:
Just how colourful are birds?
How quickly does plumage colour evolve?
Are evolutionary changes in plumage colour associated with the origin of new species?
Project overview
1. Selecting specimens
Specimens are selected from the bird collections at the Natural History Museum, London. Where possible, three males and three females are chosen for each species. Our aim is to photograph as many bird species as possible.
2. Photographs: human-visible and UV light
We photograph each specimen with a specialist camera that can capture human-visible (400–700 nm) and ultraviolet (UV, 300–400 nm) wavelengths of light. We take photos in pairs, first with a filter that only transmits human-visible wavelength and second with a filter that only transmits UV wavelengths. We take six photographs of each specimen:
a. Back view — visible + UV
b. Side view — visible + UV
c. Belly view — visible + UV
3. Zooniverse!
To make sense of the colour information stored in the photographs, we need to identify different areas of the bird's plumage, such as the crown, breast and tail. Colour in these different ""patches"" can serve different functions in different species, often including signalling (e.g. attracting mates, warning predators). We need your help to mark each of 10 different patches on the photographs.
There are two main workflow types: points and outline.
– Points - place points to locate 10 key bird body regions.
– Outline - trace the outline by drawing a polygon around the edge of the bird
Each workflow can be performed on three different views of the bird (back, side, belly).
4. Data & Discoveries
The points you place provide us with {X,Y} coordinates telling us where to measure within each image. Based on this information, we then extract data on colouration and pattern for each specimen, which we use to tackle important unanswered questions on the causes of evolution of colouration and the role that colour differences play in the origin of species.
5. Outcomes
The database that you can help to build starts from museum collections. Our aim is to pass the data back to the NHM via the Data Portal. This means that you will be contributing not only to research on bird evolution but also helping to build a digital legacy of museum collections.
How can you help?
We need your help to identify key areas of bird plumages to generate the raw data we need to tackle big, unanswered questions about evolution. Along the way, you will:
1. See a dazzling array of plumages from many thousands of species – some of which are now vanishingly rare
2. Explore hidden dimensions of plumage colouration by studying both human-visible and UV images of birds
3. Directly contribute to the most ambitious study of animal colouration ever undertaken
4. Help advance our understanding of the way evolution works and how biodiversity is generated and maintained.

76;Floating Forests;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/floating-forests/about/research;"Overview
Welcome to Floating Forests, where you can help us uncover the history of Giant Kelp forests around the globe. Most life on the seafloor can only be sampled by SCUBA divers or dredging up samples from the deep. This kind of data requires a ton of (really fun) effort to collect, but it means we’re limited to places we can get to! Given the worldwide distribution of kelp, we need your help to track it across time and space.
Why is kelp important?

A typical view from beneath the waves in a kelp forest
Giant Kelp is amazing - it can grow up to a foot a day and forms lush canopies that can be seen by some of the earliest satellites man put into space! Kelp has captured people's attention for centuries. Its high iodine content saw it used as a medieval goiter treatment. Darwin wrote about it in The Voyage of the Beagle. It was burned to ash and used to make glass in the 1700s and 1800s. It's really quite incredible how important this beautiful seaweed has been!
Giant kelp forests are one of the most exciting ecosystems on earth! Kelp is what we call a ‘foundation species’. In ecosystems where it is present (roughly 25% of the world’s coastlines!) it forms the foundation of the entire ecosystem. It provides food for all manner of herbivores from tiny shrimp to ravenous sea urchins to grazing fish.

Kelp forests are one of the most biodiverse habitats on Earth. Every nook and cranny is jam-packed with life!
Speaking of fish, it provides habitat and hiding places for fish and other organisms on the seafloor. It can dampen coastal waves as they sweep in towards shore. What many people don't know is that kelp is an important source of many ingrediants, like alginate. These ingredients find their way into many household products from shampoo to ice cream. Loss of kelp forests can have dire consequences for the health, resilience, and productivity of our coastal ecosystems
Why do we need your help?
The images you’re looking at come from photographs taken from the Landsat series of satellites. These satellites photograph the entire surface of the earth every 16 days, and have been doing so since 1984. When one of our project scientists first began working with these images, he had hoped he could just throw the hundreds of thousands of images into some image classification software, and have the software tell him where kelp was located. There’s just one problem:
Kelp is tricky.
Landsat was not designed to be able to see kelp. Kelp’s reflectance signature (the color of light that it reflects) is just at the edge of the camera's detection abilities. Because of this, kelp and something as simple as the glint of sun off of a wave look the same to a computer. But to a person, the shapes and patterns of kelp forests are fairly obvious. That’s where you come in. By tracing patches of kelp, you can do a far more accurate job than a computer, helping to process this mountain of data!"
77;Parasite Safari;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/gtitcomb/parasite-safari/about/research;"Project goal
We are investigating how water sources in the African savanna may act as disease hotspots by aggregating animals and promoting parasite transmission. We start by looking at the ways in which the presence of water changes soil and vegetation, both of which may in turn affect both animal movement and parasite survival. Using camera trapping, we measure how the presence of water changes animal density and animal contacts.
Research Sites
We're working at Ol Pejeta Conservancy -- one of Kenya's top centers for conservation and a popular destination for visitors across the world. Through our partnership with the Ecological Monitoring Unit, we've successfully run a large-scale water manipulation experiment to study its effect on animal movement and disease. We've recorded animal activity at these water sources for over two years, and we could really use your help to identify and count all the animals!
Background and motivation
Humans are changing the planet in a multitude of ways (habitat modification, wildlife loss, and climate change are a few examples). These changes will likely affect how many important parasites are spread, whether this is by altering the density and behavior of hosts, or affecting the survival and infectivity of their parasites.
For many parasites that can be contracted from the environment, hotspots can play an important role in affecting transmission. Watering holes are a perfect example of potential disease hotspots, and they are particularly relevant in arid climates, where the impacts of climate change and human development are likely to be pronounced.
Both climate change and seasonality can affect multiple aspects of disease transmission at watering holes by:
Driving a greater number of infected hosts to drink (and likely increasing the density of infectious material at watering holes),
Physically concentrating infectious material in the landscape through lower water levels and decreased surface area from which to drink, and
Increasing the number of susceptible hosts that drink from the watering hole. At the same time, these conditions may also accelerate parasite development at the cost of decreased survival in the environment.
In this project, we consider several ways in which watering holes can influence communities -- from shifts in soil and vegetation to changing large mammal behavior -- and how these effects, in turn, can affect parasite transmission.
But what about the parasites?
While the Zooniverse component of this project doesn't directly feature the real stars of the show (all the parasites!), the data collected here will be critical for understanding host contacts and risk of exposure to parasites in water. We think about watering holes as hubs of activity (blue dots below), that can connect hosts (red dots) of different species across landscapes. Watering holes could help parasites to survive and transmit across wider geographic distances and across many more species.
Many different parasites and pathogens can be found in water bodies, such as protozoans (things like Giardia and Cryptosporidium), helminths (like strongyle nematodes), viruses (like the virus that causes foot-and-mouth disease and enteric viruses), and a diversity of bacterial pathogens (from deadly anthrax to stomach-turning E-coli).
In other components of this project, we go to the very water tanks that you see in the photographs and test water using a range of methods. We also quantify other features of the sites, such as vegetation (so we know what sites are also appealing for food resources), soil chemicals (important for understanding degradation), weather (which can directly influence animal behavior and parasite survival), and dung cover (that's right -- we go out there and count animal dung at all these sites!)."
78;Seabirdwatch;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/penguintom79/seabirdwatch/about/research;"Because seabirds spend the majority of their life at sea and feed near the top of the food chain, changes in their populations are likely to reflect changes occurring in the wider ecosystem, making them excellent indicators of the health of the marine environment. However, the world's seabirds are in decline. Fisheries, pollution, invasive predators, habitat destruction and human disturbance have all had significant impacts on seabird populations, making them the most threatened group of birds globally.
Impacts can occur at any stage of the seabird annual cycle including failure to find enough local food to successfully raise chicks during the breeding season, failing to find enough food over winter to reach breeding condition, predators taking chicks before they can fly away, or direct mortality of adults from fisheries bycatch. Understanding where and how seabirds are most impacted will enable us to better conserve them, but we need data on a massive scale in order to disentangle local impacts from wider impacts such as climate change.
Why Cameras?
Intensive monitoring at many locations becomes prohibitively expensive given the number of seabird species and breeding sites globally, and long-term monitoring programs needed to assess population trends are often hampered by difficult to access colonies. Camera technology affords us the ability to collect data in hard-to-reach areas, or in places where human presence might disturb wildlife, and better understand how changes in the marine environment affect seabirds.
Despite the fantastic possibilities of cameras as a monitoring tool, they generate an enormous amount of data in the form of hundreds of thousands of images. In order to turn this massive database of information into a data set that we can use to answer research questions, we need your collective help to identify seabirds in images and record when they successfully raise chicks.
Project goals
Images taken throughout the year at multiple locations provide the ability to answer a range of interesting questions. Specifically, we aim to:
Determine chick survival and breeding success, and how this varies across species ranges.
Identify the causes of chick mortality (e.g. predation in the colony versus parents abandoning chicks)
Record changes in the timing of breeding (e.g. arrival date, fledging date) and how this is affected by environmental conditions
We have many camera monitoring sites around the North Atlantic. The images in this project come from Ireland, Northern Ireland, Wales, Iceland, Svalbard, Faroes and Greenland so far, and you will be helping us collect really useful data from these spectacular locations!
SVALBARD
Alkehornet (image code ALKE) is located on the west coast of Svalbard (78.211362°N, 13.783972° E) near the entrance to the large Isfjord where Longyearbyen, the largest settlement on Svalbard is located. There is evidence that the kittiwake population has declined since the 1990s but has been recovering since 2012 at this location.
Midterhukfjellet (site code in images MITT) is a mixed kittiwake and guillemot colony located on the south side of the Belsund fjord on the west coast of Svalbard (77.663908°N, 14.87916°E). It is the first seabirdwatch camera monitoring site established in Svalbard in summer 2014. While we had early success at this site in our first year of monitoring, the cameras were swept away by an avalanche over the winter of 2015 and the camera was replaced in 2016 and successfully downloaded again in 2017.
Ossian Sarsfjellet (site code in images OSSI) is located in northwest Svalbard (78.941015°N, 12.491033°E). The area is within a nature reserve and hosts a large population of kittiwakes. This is one of the latest additions to the seabirdwatch camera monitoring network.
Kapp Waldburg (site code in images KAPP) is located in the southeast of Svalbard on Barents island (78.2579°N, 22.0307°E). The site is a dramatic 'canyon' with a large colony of kittiwakes nesting on both sides. The site is a new addition to SeabirdWatch with the first monitoring data coming from the 2018 breeding season.
GREENLAND
Kippaku (site code in images KIPP) is a small steep rocky island in the northern part of Upernavik, Northwest Greenland (73.719° N, -56.625° W). The colony is among the best studied seabird colony in Greenland and is important for both black-legged kittiwake and Brünnich Guillemot. Both species have increase slightly in numbers over the past three decades. Based on the most recent photo survey in 2013, the colony counts 4,200 occupied kittiwake nests and 19,700 individual guillemots.
Apparsuit (site code in images APPA) is a large steep rocky island in the northern part of Upernavik, Northwest Greenland (73.785° N, -56.715° W). The colony used to be one of the largest Brünnich guillemot colony in Greenland with more than 150,000 individuals in the late 1980s and early 90s, but a large gradual decline has occurred ever since. The reason for the decline is not clear. Based on the most recent photo survey in 2013, the colony counts 840 occupied kittiwake nests and 66,700 individual guillemots.
ICELAND
Ellidaey Island (site code in images ELLI), (65.09°N, 22.49°W) is a steep rocky island (0,23 km2) in the Breidafjordur bay, West Iceland. The black-legged kittiwake is the most numerous breeding bird in the island, but the colony today (600-800 nests) is nevertheless only a fraction of it‘s size a few decades ago. Other breeding birds on the island include the Atlantic puffin, northern fulmar, European shag, and black guillemot.
Hvitabjarnarey Island (site code in images HVIT), (65.08°N, 22.68°W) is a small (0,03 km2) uninhabited, rocky island in the Breidafjordur bay, West Iceland. It‘s name translates as polar bear island, even though you are very unlikely to encounter one in the area today. Between 300 and 600 black-legged kittiwake pairs build their nests in the steep cliffs surrounding the island. The size of the kittiwake colony has been relatively stable in the last decade after a decrease from 2003-2007. Other breeding seabirds on the island include black guillemot, common eider, Atlantic puffin and northern fulmar.
FAROES
Mykines (site code in images MYKI) is the westernmost of the 18 islands making up the Faroe Islands (62.1000652°N, -7.660963°E). Home to the largest Atlantic puffin colony on the Faroes (approx. 120,000 pairs) it is also home to several other seabird species with both smaller and larger kittiwake colonies and the only place gannets breed on the Faroe Islands. Situated in the middle of the North-East Atlantic Ocean it is a windy place with long dark winters but equally long and light summers, which the various seabird species take good advantage of.
UK/IRELAND
The Skelligs (site code in images SKELL) comprises two islands; Skellig Michael and Little Skellig, located off the west coast of Ireland in County Kerry (51.771486°N, -10.539689°W). They are perhaps Ireland’s most famous seabird colonies. In addition to Ireland’s largest Northern gannet colony on Little Skellig and a large population of puffins on Skellig Michael, both islands are home to large populations of guillemots and kittiwakes. There are more than 800 occupied kittiwake nests and 2750 individual guillemots recorded across both islands.
Skomer (site code in images SKOM) is an island located off the south west coast of Wales on the Pembrokeshire coastline (57.73611°N, -5.29628°W). The island is a well established and monitored reserve home to large numbers of seabirds. 1477 apparently occupied kittiwake nests were counted on the island during 2016. The last guillemot count was in 2015 and reported 12822 individual birds on the cliff edges throughout the island.
Rathlin Island (site code in images RATH) is located off the Northern coast of County Antrim in Northern Ireland (55.29213°N, -6.19168°W), it is the northern most point of Northern Ireland. The island is a special area of conservation and is the largest seabird colony in Northern Ireland; home to tens of thousands of seabirds during the summer months. Cliff counts reported a total of 130445 individual guillemots on the cliffs and 7922 kittiwake nests around the island.
Puffin Island (site code in images PUFF), located just off the Eastern tip of Anglesey (53.3166°N, -4.0166°W), is a well-studied seabird colony home to a variety of species. The uninhabited island is a special protection area for seabirds, containing one of the largest cormorant colonies in the UK. Recent counts have estimated 413 pairs of breeding kittiwakes on the island and 2249 breeding pairs of guillemot on the cliff edges."

Our original project, Solar Stormwatch, resulted in a detailed catalogue of solar storms erupting from the Sun, as imaged by cameras on the twin NASA STEREO spacecraft and the analysis of users has contributed to seven scientific publications ranging from an analysis of real-time tracking of Earth-directed solar storms to a detailed analysis of dust impacts on the spacecraft as they orbit the Sun.
While the images from 2007-2010 (a period of low solar activity) have now been analysed in detail, our intention is to extend this analysis to the data between 2010 and 2016, during which time the Sun went through a period of peak activity so things should get even more interesting!
Now we would like your help with a new task, 'Storm Front' in which we are asking you to make detailed traces of the outer edge of each solar storm. In this way, we hope to refine our initial estimates in order to improve our estimates of each storm's arrival time at Earth.

80;Steelpan Vibrations;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/achmorrison/steelpan-vibrations/about/research;"The Steelpan
Originating in Trinidad and Tobago, the steelpan (sometime referred to as a steel drum) is a musical instrument created from the careful hammering on the bottom of 55-gallon barrels. Individual notes on the instrument are tuned by skilled tuners. Lead steelpans (tenor steelpans) are tuned to a chromatic scale. Most instruments access the chromatic scale by manipulating a 1-dimensional environment, like a string on a guitar or an air column in an oboe. What makes the steelpan unique and interesting to study is that the vibrations of different notes are all coupled together because the notes are all embedded in the same piece of steel.

Note layout for the Kellman tuned steelpan used in data collection
Steelpan Vibrations investigates the tonal profile, or ""timbre"", and the unique physics behind this exciting instrument! To do this, we need your help to analyze the visual data of single strikes of a steelpan, thus allowing us to map the steelpan’s vibrations!
What We Do Know
Currently, our understanding is limited to how the individual notes behave. Here are some interferograms, or patterns formed by wave interference, that show how the individual notes move when they are driven at a single frequency:

Lowest frequency resonance of a single note on a tenor steelpan
The concentric rings in the image indicate regions where the steelpan is vibrating. This is what we refer to as an antinode region, or area of maximum displacement. In fact, the rings are a bit like a contour map of the vibrations - by counting the number of rings (which are called fringes) we can have a measurement of the amplitude of the note's displacement.
Higher frequency resonances have more than one antinode region:

Second resonance of a note on a tenor steelpan

Third resonance of a note on a tenor steelpan
Note that there is a brighter white line between the two antinode regions in the above resonances (this would be an example of a node).
The Challenge
An obstacle that arose in investigating the steelpan is that the above resonances are also coupled with other regions vibrating at the same frequencies. Here are some interferograms that show how some notes are coupled:

Coupled resonances - two notes vibrating at the same frequency on the steelpan.
In the above image, you can see that there are three antinode regions.

Coupled resonances - three notes vibrating at the same frequency on the steelpan.
Five antinode regions are visible in this frame.
So the Question is… how do related vibrations propagate in different areas of the steelpan's surface?
Answering this question not only helps to quantify the steelpan's timbre, but also leads to a better understanding of how coupling vibrations may occur in other surfaces.
What we need from you!
The above images were taken in a very controlled manner, carefully selecting the frequency at which to vibrate the steelpan. But, steelpans are played by striking the notes with a drum stick. To investigate how the steelpan behaves when it is struck, we create interferograms using a high speed camera taking measurements at up to 30,000 frames per second.
The following is an example of one these interferograms!
Even if we limit our analysis to a fraction of a second, we still end up with thousands of frames to look at.
This is why we need your help! Your contributions help track the motion of the vibrations as it travels through the steelpan. We could then identify when these coupled vibrations develop and decay, and the amplitude of each region through time. Additionally, the analyzed visual recording could be paired with the audio data to correlate the mapping of the steelpan vibrations with the spectrum of sound produced.
We want you to help us in the following ways:
Identify antinode regions by counting them and drawing ellipses around them.
Counting the fringes of each antinode region.
That's it! Simple, right?
Unfortunately, the individual frames are not as clean as the above images. Here is a sample frame similar to what you might get when helping us on our data:

Single frame from high-speed interferometry
That image is representative of many of our frames that you'll be looking at. There are two or maybe three antinode regions in that frame. Do you see all of them?

81;Wildwatch Kenya;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/sandiegozooglobal/wildwatch-kenya/about/research;"Understanding and Protecting One of Africa's Most-loved Animals
Giraffes are icons of Africa, found nowhere else on Earth. They are unique, magnificent, and much loved worldwide. They are also integral to their ecosystems, opening habitat for other wildlife and livestock and dispersing seeds for new plant growth. Yet when compared to other famous species, surprisingly we don’t know much about giraffes and how they live in their native habitat. For instance, we just learned in September 2016 that there might in fact be four different species of giraffe rather than just one!
One thing we do know, unfortunately, is that giraffes are in trouble. Across Africa, all giraffe populations have declined by about 40%, leading the IUCN Red List in December 2016 to officially list giraffes as “Vulnerable” to extinction. Our project focuses on the reticulated giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis reticulata), and current estimates show that the population of these giraffes has declined by over 70% in the past 20 years—from 36,000 to less than 9,000 today. The main drivers behind the decline appear to be habitat loss and fragmentation, land degradation, and poaching.
Saving the Towers of the Savanna
We want to help giraffes and reverse that negative trend. In 2016, we launched a collaborative conservation initiative to study reticulated giraffes, which historically ranged from northern Kenya into southern Somalia and Ethiopia. Initially, we are focused at two sites in northern Kenya: the 56,000-acre Loisaba Conservancy, and the 800,000-acre Namunyak Community Conservancy. There, a team of community-led conservation researchers, the Twiga Walinzi (which means Giraffe Guards in Swahili), is conducting the field research to study these giraffes. They also monitor and keep records on individual animals, engage communities, and remove poaching snares from areas of habitat.
Picture It
Part of the research includes a network of 100 motion-activated trail cameras, which automatically take photos of animals as they pass by. Part of our job is to regularly check on these cameras to make sure they are still working, change the batteries, and replace the memory cards that store thousands of images. Sometimes we have to replace cameras that have been destroyed by weather, or even hyenas! We take the memory cards to camp and check that the pictures were taken properly, then we upload them to Wildwatch Kenya for you to review. Studying these photos allows us to understand which giraffes are using different areas of the habitat throughout the year. We also track animals other than giraffes, to understand what species share the habitat—including livestock and humans.
Plus, we take photos that show side views of giraffes and run them through pattern-recognition software. This way, we can identify and track individual giraffes—each individual has a unique coat pattern, like human fingerprints. By tracking particular giraffes, we can better understand where they go, what they do there, and how long they stay, which directs our protection efforts. We are also experimenting doing the same for leopards, identifying individuals with their unique spot patterns.
We Need You!
For Wildwatch Kenya, we would love to have you join our team and help review these trail camera photos, to identify and count the animals in them. We have tens of thousands of photos to sort through, and only a few researchers—your assistance will make a huge difference in the success of this project! We will use the results to better understand giraffe ecology and to inform our conservation efforts on the ground, for giraffes and the other species that share their habitat.
We’re working in the core of the reticulated giraffe’s range, in order to gather data on giraffe ecology and interactions, the drivers of decline, and the effects of humans that also live in this habitat. We hope this project is the first step in providing a sustainable future for giraffes, providing information to land owners and managers to assist in decision-making, and building a sense of community ownership around the conservation of this iconic animal.
Thank you for joining our team to help save giraffes!"
82;Fossil Atmospheres;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/laurasoul/fossil-atmospheres/about/research;"Fossil Atmospheres is a Smithsonian Institution citizen science project from the National Museum of Natural History and the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center.
What we want to find out
We want to create a record of how the atmosphere has changed through time by calculating the ratio of two different types of leaf cell (stomatal and epidermal) for many leaves, from the present and the geological past. We know that the composition of the Earth's atmosphere has changed over time, and that it is changing now. It is important for us to understand what effect climate change might have on life on our planet in the long term.
One way we can understand the effect of climate change is to look at the geological past - millions of years ago - and the fossil record, to see what happened to organisms during periods of time in Earth history when there were similar changes in the atmosphere and climate. If we want to build an accurate picture of these past changes, we need to know what the atmosphere was like back then.
Our planet's atmosphere is composed of many different gasses, one of which is carbon-dioxide (CO2). Through extensive research we now know that CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has a very important influence on Earth's climate. There are several ways researchers try to reconstruct past climates; we call these climate proxies. One proxy for CO2 concentration comes from plants, and is known as stomatal index. This is a measure of the number of gas-exchange holes on the surface of a leaf, relative to the number of normal cells.
The Science behind it
Find links to even more information on the science in the Education section.
Plants
Every plant survives by photosynthesis - using energy from light and carbon-dioxide to make energy in the form of sugars, which it uses to grow and repair itself. To achieve this, the plant must allow CO2 into the leaves, and allow oxygen and water (the waste products of photosynthesis) to escape. It does this through stomata. These are tiny holes in the leaf surface that can be opened and sealed shut using special 'guard' cells.
When the stomata are open, gas exchange occurs. CO2 diffuses into the leaf and oxygen and water diffuse out. Both CO2 and water are vital for the plant to function, therefore it has to regulate the amount of CO2 entering the leaves and the amount of water vapor escaping. Day-to-day each plant does this by opening and closing its stomata. From previous experiments we've found that there is an optimal number of stomata on each leaf area (the stomatal index) that allows a plant to get the most effective control on gas exchange. The optimal number of stomata depends on several different environmental factors. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is the dominant environmental factor. We know that other environmental factors such as temperature and humidity play a role, but their effect is less well understood.
If we can find out exactly how stomatal index relates to these different environmental factors we could count the stomatal index of a leaf and use it to work out the conditions when it grew. Once we can do this we will be able to use the stomatal index from many leaf specimens collected from different places and geologic time periods to reconstruct a record of how the environment changed through time.
The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum
There is one period of time that we are particularly interested in, this is the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, or PETM for short. It happened 56 million years ago and lasted for around 150,000 years. During the PETM a very large amount of carbon-dioxide was released into the atmosphere and the average temperature of the planet rapidly increased by about 5 degrees Celsius.
We hope to create a more precise and accurate record of this change in atmospheric CO2 concentration and temperature, that we can compare to changes in the animals and plants at the time to gain a greater understanding of how life on the planet responds to changing climate.
Why Ginkgos?
Ginkgos are a unique type of plant. They're gymnosperms like conifers, meaning they have seeds but don't produce flowers. The first species of Ginkgo evolved in the Permian, before the dinosaurs. One species is still alive today, so we know that Ginkgos have survived through three mass extinctions, including the one that eventually caused the dinosaurs' demise. There have been many different species of Ginkgo, but they all belong to one genus and the leaves are recognizably similar in all the different species. This makes them an ideal plant to study because they can provide a record from 300 million years ago through to the present.
How we're going to do it
This is where you come in! We have already collected and imaged lots of modern and fossil Ginkgo leaves, but we need to find their stomatal index. Once you've helped us do this we will combine the data with the results from experiments with living Ginkgo trees (see below) to produce a record of past environments. Having citizen scientists count stomatal index means that we can collect far more data than we would be able to do otherwise, as well as having many people count each image to make sure the counts are as reliable as possible.
Experiments on living trees
At the same time as you're doing all this counting, Rich Barclay is growing Ginkgo trees in specific concentrations of CO2 (up to 1000 ppm - 2.5 times present atmospheric levels) to see how they respond. There have been previous experiments of this kind, but always in lab conditions. This new experiment allows the trees to grow in their natural environment, allowing us to measure how stomatal index varies with environmental conditions in a realistic setting that is more likely to represent how stomatal numbers on leaves would have varied in real life.

Experimental Ginkgo trees at the Smithsonian
Pretty soon we will also be asking you to help us count stomata on images that we make from leaves collected from these living trees too. This will help us get a more detailed and accurate idea of the relationship between stomatal index and all the environmental factors like CO2, temperature, and humidity. By doing this we will be able to be more confident about any conclusions we draw about past climate from the fossil leaves.
Why should you care?
The sensitivity of climate to CO2 has enormous economic and societal implications because of the effect climate change will have on sea level, food production, storm strength, water availability, and many other factors. By improving our ability to quantify the effects of CO2 on climate, you will be contributing to the basic science underlying projections of future environmental change."
83;Michigan ZoomIN;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/michiganzoomin/michigan-zoomin/about/research;"Project Justification
The loss of carnivores is of growing concern because of the role they play in animal communities. Top mammal carnivores such as cougars (Puma concolor) and gray wolves (Canis lupus) help control herbivores such as deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Therefore, these species can have large impacts not only on other animal species but entire ecosystems through indirect effects on vegetation. Because people are changing landscapes by converting areas to grow food and live, and altering climates, understanding how carnivores and other species respond becomes increasingly important. Our research aims to study the distribution of carnivore communities and their prey throughout the state of Michigan with varying environmental conditions and levels of disturbance. Such information will help us anticipate consequences of future changes and understand sensitivities of species.
Specifically, the Applied Wildlife Ecology (AWE) Lab at the University of Michigan will use your animal classification from our remote camera survey to:
compare mammal species occurrence to broad-scale species distribution maps
estimate biomass across trophic levels using capture frequencies
investigate occupancy patterns of carnivores
investigate resource-use overlap including activity patterns among carnivore species, across populations, and between predator-prey species
Michigan
Named as “The Great Lake State”, Michigan touches 4 of the 5 Great Lakes and is abundant in water resources containing over 11,000 inland lakes. Michigan is uniquely comprised of two peninsulas separated by the Mackinac Straits. Like the other states in the Midwest, Michigan has a temperate climate with moderately warm summers and cold winters due to heavy lake-effect snow. Flat lowlands dominate the landscape in the east of both land masses, while the relatively mountainous region of the Upper Peninsula reaches up to 2,000 feet in elevation. Deciduous forest species (oak, hickory, maple, and beech) compose the vegetation of the Lower Peninsula to the south, while evergreen species (white spruce, balsam fir, jack pine) appear as the latitude increases, expanding the plant diversity of the forests.
With just under 10 million residents across the state, the center of the population is located in Shiawassee County in southeast Michigan. Michigan’s economy is largely based on the automotive and tech industry. Therefore, human development and urbanization often invade into the natural wilderness. Even in the Upper Peninsula where human population is sparse, the logging industry drives the economy and simultaneously affects the forest composition. Human intervention has altered the ecological communities of wildlife species. Of the 65 species of mammals native to Michigan, some are endangered or threatened in their environments, notably the gray wolf (Canis lupus) and Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis). These species spark conservation concerns and the state government continues to improve regulations and restrictions to revive these endangered populations. However, the bigger picture of conservation urges for maintaining ecological interactions within communities in order to secure them for the future.

The Bitterroot Valley contains diverse stakeholders. We’ve experienced rapid growth in recent years, but much of the landscape is still dominated by agricultural activities. Conservation groups like Bitterroot Audubon and the Bitter Root Land Trust have worked hard on voluntary efforts to protect wildlife, working lands, and water in our community. However, like agricultural communities in many areas, our working lands and their stewards are often underappreciated for the habitat services they provide to all community members. We hope to work towards bridging this gap.
This research project is a combination of efforts between Raptor View Research Institute , MPG Ranch , and Bitterroot Audubon . RVRI has been studying overwintering eagles in western Montana since 2011. They have captured over 100 Golden and 30 Bald Eagles, and deployed wing tags, numbered leg bands, and/or satellite transmitters on individuals depending on their species and age.
By placing camera traps on carcasses throughout the Bitterroot Valley, we are hoping to increase the re-sighting rate of marked eagles. We know they rely heavily on private lands in the winter. We know many of our eagles, though they breed elsewhere, return to the Bitterroot Valley year after year. Other project goals include:
-Develop areas where researchers can safely trap eagles for additional banding, marking, and deployment of satellite transmitters
-Collect information on the use and importance of working lands in supporting overwintering eagle population and other scavenging wildlife species
-Encourage dialog between farmers, ranchers, and scientists about conservation issues concerning eagles, landowner needs and management goals, and the positive intersection of these two concepts
-Engage people of many backgrounds in a Citizen Science project

85;Bash the Bug;live;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/mrniaboc/bash-the-bug/about/research;"We need you to help us fight antibiotic resistance and tuberculosis!
The discovery of antibiotics in the middle of the 20th century helped reduce the number of deaths from infectious diseases globally. Unfortunately, the use of antibiotics has led to bacteria developing resistance.
To help tackle this rise in bacterial resistance to antibiotics, it is vital that Doctors know which antibiotics can and cannot be used to treat a patient with a bacterial infection such as Tuberculosis (TB). This is because using the right antibiotic to quickly kill disease-causing bacteria limits their opportunity to develop antibiotic-resistance.
Understanding which antibiotics will be effective against a particular bacterial infection is also crucial for rapid patient treatment. Currently, a sample is taken from a patient and sent to a laboratory, usually in a hospital, where the bacteria are grown and then different antibiotics administered to see which ones are effective. For a slow-growing bacterium like TB this process can take around a month. We want to speed this process up and help cure patients faster.
  Why tuberculosis?
Tuberculosis is one of the top ten causes of death worldwide, with 1.4 million people dying from TB in 2015. In addition, many people with HIV also die from TB - the same year a further 0.4 million people died from TB who were living with HIV. The World Health Organisation estimated that there were 10.4 million new TB cases in 2015.
  Overview of our research
Due to the incredible rate at which gene sequencing has got faster and cheaper, it is now possible to replace traditional lab-based methods of research with approaches using genetic technology. Our research aim is to use a genetics-based approach to improve the treatment of TB and reduce the spread of bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Understanding which changes in the bacterial genome (mutations) lead to antibiotic resistance enables the identification of which antibiotics can be used to treat a particular patient, in around a week, rather than a month.
  Our research methods
The CRyPTIC project will collect over 20,000 TB infection samples from around the world. The project will run for five years starting in early 2017. The M.tuberculosis bacteria in each sample will have its genome sequenced and also its sensitivity to a range of antibiotics determined using a small 96 well plate. Each circular well has a different dose of one of 14 antibiotics. Every sample collected will be split and a small amount put into each well. After two or three weeks each well in the plate is examined to see if bacteria are growing or not and a photograph is taken, like the one below.
 

 
By comparing these results to the genetic sequence of that infection, we can work out which changes in the genome cause resistance (and equally importantly, which do not). All this information will help us understand and better predict in the future which M.tuberculosis bacteria will be resistant to which antibiotics.
  Where are the samples coming from?
The CRyPTIC project is a consortium of laboratories from different countries, including Peru, Vietnam, India, South Africa, China, Italy and the UK. The list of participating labs can be found at the bottom of this page.
  Why we need your help!
Although each plate will be examined by a scientist, they, like all of us, might miss something. It is vital for the success of the project that we accurately determine which antibiotics are effective for each and every of the 20,000 TB samples. We hope that by combining the expert opinion with the consensus developed by you, the volunteers, we will get a much more accurate assessment of each plate. Take a look at the project and tutorial for more information about how you can help. We're also trying to use computers to process the images produced in this study, but they can be fooled by shadows, air bubbles and other things in the images.

Update: As of 2018/01/11, we have put data from the next year of K2 on the website. This includes light curves from calibrated K2 data files in Campaigns 12, 13, and 14, and the initial uncalibrated data files in the recent Campaign 15.
Overview:
Planets that pass in front of their host stars cause a dip in the brightness of the star making them discoverable. This is called the transit method of exoplanet detection. This method offers unique opportunities to characterize planetary masses, radii, densities, atmospheric composition, and orbital alignments, to name just a few aspects of interest. Transiting planets are also the most common type of exoplanet known, thanks in large part to NASA's Kepler spacecraft. Data from Kepler's initial four-year survey revealed over 4,000 candidate exoplanets. many of these candidates have been confirmed as real exoplanets by observing how they make their stars 'wobble' are they orbit. The wobble of the star can be measured by observing the spectrum of the star's light. This is called the radial velocity method of exoplanet detection.

The K2 Mission
The majority of all exoplanets known today were discovered by Kepler. After the spacecraft's loss of a second reaction wheel in 2014, the original mission was abandoned and a new mission named K2 was proposed and eventually began in 2014. It embarked on a new survey of the ecliptic plane, divided into campaigns of roughly 80 days each. In terms of survey area, time coverage, and data release strategy, K2 provides a natural transition from Kepler to the future TESS mission. Kepler observed 1/400th of the sky for four years, while TESS will observe nearly the entire sky for over 27 days, and smaller fractions of the sky will be observed for up to a year.

Exoplanet Explorers
In this project, we need volunteers to look through K2 data and discover any transiting exoplanets present. This will allow us to measure the occurrence rates of different types of planets orbiting different types of stars. Are small planets (like Venus) more common than big ones (like Saturn)? Are short-period planets (like Mercury) more common than those on long orbits (like Mars)? Do planets more commonly occur around stars like the Sun, or around the more numerous, cooler, smaller ""red dwarfs""?

With your help through this Zooniverse project, we'll extract figures first from astronomy papers published in American Astronomical Society journals and make them publicly available and searchable through data archives - e.g., the American Astronomical Society's Astronomy Image Explorer - and through the American Astronomical Society's WorldWide Telescope.
Once we've identified what figure types are on each page, the next workflow will allow you to view sky figures with axes labeled in their full sky context within WorldWide Telescope.
For images you mark that do not have labeled axes, we'll use Astrometry.net for calibration. This is a service that can algorithmically determine the scale and position of images on the sky.
The final result will be a database of astro-referenced images, i.e., images of the sky for which we have coordinates, orientation, and pixel scale. These astro-referenced images will be publicly available through data archives, the Astronomy Image Explorer, and WorldWide Telescope, thanks to your help!

93;Jungle Weather;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/khufkens/jungle-weather/about/research;"Introduction
Our understanding of forest ecosystem and their response to climate change relies on consistent long-term observations which provide a baseline or reference. Yet, observing and measuring tropical plant species and the climatic (weather) conditions in which they reside is demanding, particularly in the central Congo Basin. Established long-term observation programs are therefore rare. In terms of meteorological observations, the central Congo Basin is currently represented by only a few rain gauges, limiting climate forecasts across the Congo Basin and the central African continent. This lack of long-term (historical) climatological data leaves the central Congo Basin spatially and temporally under-represented in both climatological and ecological (model) studies. However, old climate records could provide valuable information about previous growing conditions of the forest.
Large amounts of ecological and climatological data, approximately five decades (~1910 – 1960), exists as unexplored heritage, stored in various Belgian federal archives and collections. As part of a larger project called Congo Basin eco-climatological data recovery and valorization (COBECORE, www.cobecore.org) the ""Jungle Weather"" project will need your help transcribe historical climatological data as measured throughout the Congo Basin. Due to the large volumes of data and the limited options to automate transcription with optical character recognition (OCR) techniques your help is crucial in the full transcription of these historical records. Although various projects aim to improve the automation of transcription tasks, e.g. the European DARIAH project, to date, transcription of tables of handwritten data remains a challenge. The transcribed data therefore will give insight in the climate of the central African rainforest, will complement the completed Jungle Rhythms Zooniverse project, and contribute to machine learning training datasets in order to automate future transcription efforts.
The data
Within this project we will focus on data records as recorded throughout the tropical part of what is currently the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The area which we will cover is shown above in the map as an open polygon. The project will not cover the southern province of Katanga (red crosshatches) as this area transitions here from tropical to a humid subtropical climate.
The historical data is archived and stored in the Belgian State Archives. The Belgian State Archive harbour almost all data regarding colonial affairs, ranging from communications about trade to the raw data as digitized within the context of the Jungle Weathers project. Row upon row of data is stored in the basement. Below you see a part of the INEAC (Institut National pour l’Etude Agronomique du Congo belge) archive, which holds all climatological records.
These climatological records were noted rigorously on carbon copy paper. However, due to the hand written nature of the data (and the volume involved) automated processing is not possible. Although optical character recognition (OCR) works wonderfully on printed data the high variability in characters and the low contrast pencil markings contribute to the failure of current automated approaches. Similar to the Old Weather project and in spirit of the Jungle Rhythms project, a keen eye is required to decipher the numbers written down on these sheets.
Pre-Processing / digitization
The project will provide you, citizen scientists, with digital pictures of the original sheets. Scanning these climate data sheets was a laborious process. In total more than 70 000 records were digitized. Unlike the Old Weather project we do not require you to outline valid sections of the sheet. This part of the processing has been automated. Below you see an example of the automated machine learning (ML) based screening. A visualization of the screening results of one particular table are given below. The light blue pixels represent those of a template we use to figure out where valuable data is in the table, red/pink pixels represent those of the table data, blue pixels show agreement between the template and the matched table and, finally, white crosses indicate empty cells as predicted through ML.
As such, once digitized and properly aligned the whole record will be divided into an estimated 30 million cells. Of those a substantial number are empty. Only rows which are flagged as completely empty will be omitted from transcription. This routine saves a considerable amount of time and effort and lowers the number of actual values to transcribe to roughly 10 million cells.
The cells are padded so they might include some of their neighbours. This is needed to ensure that all data is included in case the hand written numbers do not stick to the nice layout of the table. As with all citizen science projects your feedback is essential in tracking strange cases and transcribing the correct data. In the below example you see that the data (on the bottom line) reads 10.1.
Machine Learning based transcription
In addition to data screening, data recovery will also rely on Machine Learning. Data will be transcribed in sections, using a subset of the complete dataset to provide training data for these automated algorithms. Despite the flexibility and power of these algorithms large training datasets are required to represent the variety of handwritten numbers in this large dataset.
Workflows
Two workflows will be provided, one workflow will cover the measurements, or the Transcribe Climate Data workflow. The Transcribe Meta-Data workflow will complement these data with additional information on the site's ID number, and month and year of observation. You are free to choose where to contribute. The meta-data workflow includes multiple steps and is probably less easy to execute on tablet or smartphone. Transcribing measurements from cells is easy and lends itself better to mobile device use."
94;Weather 100 - Eskdalemuir;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/malcolma1/weather-100-eskdalemuir/about/research;"Long-term meteorological observations are part of the irreplaceable cultural and scientific heritage of mankind that serve the needs of current and future generations for long-term high quality climate records. They are unique sources of past information about atmospheric parameters, thus are references for climate variability and change assessments. To highlight this importance, WMO has a mechanism to recognize centennial observing stations, Eskdalemuir Observatory in the Scottish Borders with continuous meteorological records spanning more than 100 years between 1910 and current day being one such site. By so doing, the WMO (World Meteorological Organisation) promotes sustainable observational standards and best practices that facilitate the generation of high-quality time series data
Whilst all recent and current data is stored electronically in the UK Climate database hosted by the Met Office, there are long periods that pre date the technological revolution where the data exists solely on the paper forms on which the observations were originally recorded.
An example of one such journal is shown below
The Eskdalemuir Observatory has paper climate records going back over 100 years but there are few records digitised pre 1950 . Our objective is to get climate data digitised to give continuous 100 year record which can aid climate modelling in future and help explain events in the past.
Over the period to be digitised three different types of daily journal and registers were used and it is copies of these journals which will need to be interpreted and classified .
In the first part of the project we will be asking volunteers to collect air pressure and temperature data covering a period from 1915-1923 when the small pocket book was used to record the observations
The completed data will be assimilated to climate models, greatly assisting with cutting edge climate predictions. Historic meteorological data is also required to put severe weather events into context and with potentially in excess of 100 years of digitised data from Eskdalemuir, trends and patterns will be identifiable to feed into a variety of planning purposes aligning with the Met Office purpose to help people stay safe and thrive.

On The Koster seafloor observatory we publish snapshots of deep-water recordings from the Kosterhavets National Park in Sweden.
About the study area
The Kosterhavets National Park is Sweden's first marine national park with a size of 389 square km. The area contains a highly diverse and unique marine ecosystem that is under active protection and management since 2009. Close to the bottom of the Koster-Väderö fjord the conditions are very similar to those in the open Atlantic Ocean. Here, sub-surface currents continuously transport larvae of deep oceanic species into the Koster fjord. As a result, there are many bottom dwelling species living here, which are otherwise only found in deep Atlantic waters. Large sponges, starfish and cold-water corals are some of them. You can see them in the photographs below.

Here is a map of Kosterhavets National Park. On the left hand side, you can see the location of the park. Actually, there are two national parks, on the Swedish side of the border is the Kosterhavet National Park, and on the Norwegian side, there is the Ytre Hvaler National Park. On the right hand side you can see the borders of the Kosterhavets National Park, its the archipelago, and the underwater seascape showing the deep water trench in dark blue. Map drawn by Hans Sjögren.
About the flora and fauna
Hidden under the sea in the Kosterhavet National Park you can find a rich and diverse underwater landscape: cliffs and deep valleys, dark clay sea beds, forests of seaweed and rocky reefs, shallow bays and narrow straits. The variation of habitats and ecosystems creates conditions for an unusually rich flora and fauna. With over 6000 different marine seaweeds and animals, Kosterhavets National Park is the most species-rich marine environment in Sweden.

The Common sunstar (Crossaster papposus) is a typical inhabitant of the seafloor in the National Park, photo Tomas Lundälv och Lisbeth Jonsson.

The Football sponge (Geodia sp.) is a large deep-sea species found in the boreal waters of the North Atlantic Ocean, and it is fairly common in the National Park.
About our research and the history of underwater filming
For the last 30 years, the scientists at the Tjärnö Marine Laboratory have used Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) and underwater cameras to monitor the area around the Kosterhavet National Park. The movies and images available to us today not only present an otherwise unseen part of the national park, they also can take us 30 years back in time. In our research we want to study how climate change and human activities influence the fauna in this area and which positive effects the protective status as national park had on the seafloor habitats.

This photo shows a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) that has been filming the study site since the mid 1990's. It generated a unique time series with more than 20 years of recordings from the seafloor in this area.
Acknowledgements
A large part of the movies has been recorded during biological inventories commissioned by the County Administrative Board of Västra Götaland. We are deeply grateful to the ROV-pilots and the database curators at Tjärnö Marine Laboratory (especially Tomas Lundälv, Lisbeth Jonsson, Roger A. Johansson, Lars-Ove Loo and Per Bergström), who maintained this collection for many years.
About the quality of underwater images and movies
Underwater images are usually of poor quality when compared with images and movies taken on land. This is because there is little natural light below 20 m (i.e. below the photic zone) and the water is very often turbid and filled with particles blurring the recordings. In addition, the camera may not stand still while filming because of the currents in the water. Together these factors often create fuzzy images and these conditions are almost impossible to control for. Hence, we must work with the image quality as is.
How can you help us?
In order to study the long-term changes on the sea floor and understand what effects the protection status of the park have, we need to analyse the species composition over time using the ROV footage. Do you want to help us? Great!"

97;Wild Mont-Blanc;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/crea-mont-blanc/wild-mont-blanc/about/research;"The project
Wild Mont-Blanc is a program developed by the Research Center for Alpine Ecosystems (CREA Mont-Blanc, a nonprofit research center based in Chamonix-Mont-Blanc, France) and initiated by ""Communauté de Communes de la Vallée de Chamonix-Mont-Blanc"". CREA Mont-Blanc is working to measure how climate change is impacting different alpine environments, and understand how alpine species can (or cannot) adapt to their changing environment. Wild Mont-Blanc provides an important contribution to this research, adding the monitoring of fauna to the CREA Mont-Blanc’s ongoing studies of vegetation and climate in the Mont-Blanc massif.
This project was financed by ""Agence de l'environnement et de la maîtrise de l'énergie - Programme d'Investissements d'Avenir"" and by ""Communauté de Communes de la Vallée de Chamonix-Mont-Blanc"".

Our camera traps are installed every 200 meters along an elevation gradient, allowing us to observe all of the different natural environments found in the Mont-Blanc massif (forest, shrubland, grassland, moraine).
Why this project ?
It is especially challenging to study changes in the abundance or activity of animals (mammals and birds) in hard-to-access mountain terrain. It’s also difficult to count animals that are constantly moving around vast habitats. Camera traps are powerful tools allowing us to monitor animal activity with an easily repeatable protocol. Beginning in 2018, CREA Mont-Blanc installed a network of 40 camera traps between 1,300 and 2,700 meters of elevation on the different aspects of Mont-Blanc, creating a network that helps us analyze seasonal variations in the ways that different species use their habitats. The cameras allow us to collect data on altitudinal migration, rhythm of activity, feeding behavior, and molting dates. Identifying the species observed in the photos also helps us improve an automated system of photo analysis that will allow us to analyze a huge number of photos over the long term.
The Mont-Blanc Massif
The Mont-Blanc massif is located in the heart of the Alps, at the crossroads of France, Italy and Switzerland. With its exceptional relief, it offers a diversity of climatic conditions and ecosystems spanning more than 4,500 m of elevation, making it a unique laboratory for the study of mountain ecosystems. Since the beginning of the 20th century, the Alps have experienced temperature increases at twice the rate of the rest of the Northern Hemisphere. As a result, the Mont-Blanc massif is also a remarkable study site for understanding how mountain ecosystems are responding to climate change.
Scientific questions
Wild Mont-Blanc will help us answer the following questions:
How do alpine species adapt to changes in their environment? Are animals changing where they go and how they use different habitats? If so, which species? And in which seasons? Does this have an impact on vegetation?
Can we observe long-term changes in the abundance of different species? With climate change, which species are winners and which are losers?
How do decreases in snow cover duration impact alpine species (particularly for species like mountain hare, ermine and rock ptarmigan that change color in winter and summer)? Are these species able to adapt and change their camouflage strategy by modifying their molting dates or behavior?

A chamois in a shrubland
We need your help

98;Vintage Cuban Radio;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/ucla-idep/vintage-cuban-radio/about/research;"About the collection
Universidad del Aire (University on the Air) was an educational radio program that began airing on Radio CMQ in Havana, Cuba in 1948 during the presidency of Carlos Prío Socarras and later during the US-backed dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista up through 1963, the initial years of the Cuban Revolution led by Fidel Castro. This didactic radio show featured lectures by prominent Cuban intellectuals and cultural figures (i.e. Alejo Carpentier, Nicolás Guillen, José Lezama Lima, Jorge Mañach) on a wide variety of themes from art, history, politics and music. The program was recorded live by the radio station on lacquer discs and accompanied by a published cuaderno (notebook) on the discussed topics. The topics discussed and live audience question and answer sessions recorded on Universidad del Aire provide unique insight into the social and political tensions in pre and post-revolutionary Cuba.
The only known recordings of Universidad del Aire are held by the Institute of Cuban History (IHC) based in Havana, Cuba. The Universidad del Aire recordings are extremely fragile and were digitized from lacquer discs in 2017-2018 through a collaboration between UCLA Library and the IHC as part of the International Digital Ephemera Project. (Read more about the preservation and digitization process here.) These recordings have never been accessible to researchers and offer new opportunities for scholarship.

About the project
We want to create tables of contents and full-text transcriptions for the Universidad del Aire radio recordings to enable deep engagement with the audio material as well as promote re-use of the collection for computationally driven research and teaching. We are asking volunteers to identify speaker's voices, ads, and music which will help us create a table of contents for the program (no Spanish required for this task). Volunteers can also transcribe segments in Spanish. Creating full-text transcriptions will also open up the collection to a wider audience, such as researchers with reading knowledge of Spanish but not strong aural comprehension. Creating full-text transcripts will also enable us to identify if there are segments that should be prioritized for translation into English.
Who will use the collection
The collection would be of interest to researchers working in the disciplines of Latin American Studies, Caribbean Studies, Spanish & Portuguese, history, anthropology, music, literature, and sound studies. Based on preliminary listens of the collection, some potential research areas could be connections between African diaspora intellectuals, Afrocuban history and relations, censorship in Cuba, Cuban poetry and literature, Cuban rumba music, Latin American solidarity and regional identity. The collection would also be of interest to radio and sound historians and Spanish language learners."

The Screen Arts Mavericks & Makers Collection at the University of Michigan Library preserves 1,344 letters sent to the New York City office of Orson Welles’s Mercury Theatre in the aftermath of the broadcast, which were kept by one of Welles’s producing partners and largely forgotten for seventy years. Increased public interest in these letters, following their being featured in a 2013 PBS documentary and the 2015 book Broadcast Hysteria, inspired our initiative to create a digital archive making them more accessible to scholars and students. Not only do these letters offer a unique window into early American radio broadcasting and reception by documenting how audiences reacted to one of the most important programs in the medium’s history; they also present an opportunity to make radio history come alive by using the full story of War of the Worlds to address issues of media misinformation and “fake news” particularly relevant to our present moment.
Our project makes the War of the Worlds letters—and the many personal stories they contain—digitally available to researchers and the general public, fully searchable by city, state, and transcribed text. The digital database will also include vetted lesson plans we created in collaboration with several teachers and schools in Southeast Michigan to help teach an array of subjects aimed at middle school, high school, and community college students. Together, these resources make the letters the intellectual center for lessons about American political and media history before World War II, fact-checking and news bias and reliability, radio performance, and English."
100;Sagehen Mammal Quest;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/gtitcomb/sagehen-mammal-quest/about/research;"Who are we?
Sagehen Creek Field Station is a research and teaching facility of the University of California at Berkeley. We are embedded within the Sagehen Experimental Forest, a 9000-acre headwater basin of the Truckee River, located north of Truckee, CA in the central Sierra Nevada.
Sagehen was started in 1951 specifically for fisheries and wildlife studies. Today, our research and education portfolio has expanded to include kid's programs, art, hydrology, forest health and much more, but wildlife biology is still a big emphasis here.
Much of what we know about wild trout was learned at Sagehen in the 1950's and 1960's. American marten have been studied and monitored in the basin since 1979; in fact, the first wolverine documented in California since 1922 showed up on a marten researcher's camera trap at Sagehen in 2008, and he has been photographed by camera traps in the area every year since. The Highway-89 Stewardship Team is using camera traps to discover how wildlife interacts with the highway that runs through the lower Sagehen basin. Researchers from the University of Nevada - Reno have studied cognition in Mountain Chickadees at Sagehen for over 20 years, discovering some amazing things about bird brains. Biologists have been tracking migratory bird productivity and survivorship at Sagehen since 1992, and monitoring bird response to the catastrophic Donner Ridge fire since 1960. And an iNaturalist volunteer documented the first otter ever recorded in the basin just last year...after almost 70 years of people looking in every corner of the basin. Amazing what's still out there, waiting to be uncovered!
The American Marten is a long-studied indicator species at Sagehen that lets us know how the system is doing: since the martens are at the top of the food chain, if they are happy that means that a lot of other things must be, too. You might even find one of these cute little guys in the photos.
You could help us make the next big discovery!
After you identify what's in the pictures, we can use a special algorithm with these un-baited camera trap photos to get population estimates of various wildlife species over time, learning how they use the landscape and how their populations respond to forest health treatments. We are expecting wildlife to benefit greatly--that's one of the big goals of our Sagehen Forest Project!

101;Rainfall Rescue;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/edh/rainfall-rescue/about/research;"The British love talking about the weather. They also love measuring it.
In the 1970s there were around 5500 rain gauges in the UK - that means you would not have been more than a couple of miles from one! Nowadays there are around 2500 which is still enough to map out variations in rainfall from month to month.
But, when we look at the number of rainfall records, it seems as though there were only a few hundred rain gauges before 1961. So what's going on?
The problem is that before 1961 there were actually thousands of rain gauges but the data has not been transferred from the original hand-written paper records to something digital so that we can use it.
This is where we need your help!
This project aims to fill in the gaps in our historical rainfall observation network. You will be shown images of rainfall data that have not yet been digitised and asked to transcribe the values and locations.
The aim is to better understand wet, dry and normal periods in our history and help water companies plan for every eventuality. For example, October 1903 was wet. Very wet. Wetter than any month we know about.
We think that October 1903 was much wetter overall than February 2020, which caused so much flooding in the UK. But it was not wetter everywhere and our existing observations are far fewer. More data will help us map out the variations with much greater precision. Other years such as 1921 and periods in the 1880s and 1890s were very dry and we need to understand why.

103;University of Wyoming Raccoon Project;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/trouille/university-of-wyoming-raccoon-project/about/research;"About the University of Wyoming Raccoon Project
As the human population continues to grow, urbanization of the land is expected to grow as well. Although many species around the globe are in currently in decline due to urbanization, we see that some species not only survive, but actually thrive in urban habitats. Animals like raccoons have demonstrated an incredible ability to adapt to new environments, including cities, and are expanding their range into new areas where they have not existed previously. Raccoons use the cover of darkness to explore human environments and are experts at exploiting human refuse, earning them the affectionate title of ""trash pandas"". They are well-known for many of their iconic physical traits, such as their dexterous forepaws, ringed tail, and bandit-like mask. Raccoons also have a reputation for being intelligent, which likely aids them in their successful conquest of human environments. Interestingly however, raccoons have been largely overlooked in the field of animal cognition, likely because of the difficulty involved in studying these nocturnal, cunning animals.
The University of Wyoming Raccoon Project was established in 2015 to better understand raccoons and their cognition, especially their ability to learn independently or from others, their ability to innovate solutions to new problems, and their ability to behave flexibly. We design various cognitive challenges, or ""puzzles"", for wild raccoons and study how they approach and solve these challenges. We use a variety of high-tech equipment and new experimental methods to conduct our trials at night without the involvement of human experimenters. We also conduct comparative research with other successful urban carnivores, such as striped skunks and coyotes.
About Our Experiment
These videos were collected during an experiment on the learning, problem-solving, and social behavior of free-ranging raccoons and skunks in the town of Laramie, Wyoming. We set up the experiment at night, when raccoons and skunks are most active. Below is a list of the equipment we used that you may be curious about.
Puzzle Box

A puzzle box is an apparatus an animal must figure out how to open in order to get a food reward. The puzzle box you see in the videos has 12 doors on each side, and behind each door is a small amount of sardines and dog kibble (a tasty treat for animals like raccoons and skunks!). We are able to measure the learning and problem-solving skills of animals in the videos by measuring (1) the amount of time it takes the animal to open each door and (2) the diversity of behaviors they use to open the doors. We also record other items of interest, such as social behaviors.
Night Vision Cameras

We set up four infrared (or ""night vision"") cameras around the puzzle box to record trials. Like us, the animals in the videos cannot see this light.
PIT tag reader

Every year the UWRP humanely traps, identifies, and releases raccoons and skunks as a part of our research. Each animal we trap is marked with a passive integrated transponder tag (""PIT tag,"" like a microchip used with pets). We place a PIT tag reader at our study site, and the reader scans and records the PIT tag number of the animals that come to the puzzle box. This way, we can match up the PIT tag records to our camera footage to find out who is who!
Ear Tags

Many of the raccoons and skunks also receive ear tags for visual identification.
Radio Collars

A subset of raccoons in our study population have been fitted with very high frequency (VHF) radio collars. We use VHF telemetry to detect the signal emitted from the collars and find the location of the raccoons after we have released them. We use this information to better understand the movement and home range size of raccoons in the town of Laramie. The majority of raccoon tracking is performed by University of Wyoming undergraduate students that are building skills for a future career in wildlife biology and management.
About the aims of our Citizen Science Project
The overall goal of this project is to gather data that will allow us to train a machine learning algorithm to distinguish between individual raccoons. We want to be able to say whether the raccoon in a video is Alice the raccoon or Bob the raccoon based on the video data alone. To get there, we need to be able to determine a few things about each video
how many animals are in a video,
where they appear in the frame,
what species each animal in the video is,
the individual identity of each of the animals in the video.
We could ask each of these questions in separate citizen science projects. However, by gathering the bounding box data for each frame in a video, we are gathering the data required to address the first three points. We will aim to use the data you provide to train a machine learning algorithm to automatically draw bounding boxes and identify the species in each box. It will take a lot of training data for the algorithm to learn to do this and it will be an iterative process. As you annotate more and more images, we will use these to improve the algorithm, allowing you to focus attention on the data that we need the most help with. For example, as the algorithm improves we should be able to remove more of the images that do not contain any animals allowing you to focus on those that do.
Once we have a reliable algorithm that can draw a box around each animal in an image and identify its species, we can link the PIT tags to the raccoons in the bounding boxes (addressing point 4. above). While this should be easy for videos with one or two raccoons, it will be a lot trickier when there are many raccoons. We might need your help again in the future to deal with these situations in order to track raccoons between frames or even identify who each of the raccoons is.
We hope to use what we learn from this work to help us identify individuals in other camera trap projects. This will allow ecologists to more accurately estimate populations of animals and enhance the study of wild animal behavior and personality."
104;Power to the People;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/alycialeonard/power-to-the-people/about/research;"About the project
Power to the People is finding rural homes in sub-Saharan Africa using satellite imagery to expand electrical access. To design electrical systems that meet the needs and desires of specific communities, we need detailed information about the places they call home.
Motivation
Close to 1 billion people live without electricity worldwide. Most live in sub-Saharan Africa or South Asia. The vast majority live in rural areas.
Electricity improves and saves lives. It allows for better healthcare through medical technologies. Electric night-time lighting allows for study and alleviates gendered safety issues. Electric cooking reduces harmful smoke and particulate exposure driven by fuel-burning cook-stoves. Productive uses of electricity, from electric grinding mills to sewing machines and refrigeration, can grow local businesses and alleviate poverty. There are so many ways electricity can improve livelihoods.
Our team is driven by the by the seventh United Nations Sustainable Development Goal, which calls for universal access to reliable and sustainable electricity by 2030. We want everyone to have access to electricity; in our modern, technology-driven world, electricity is essential in ensuring equal opportunity to thrive.
Achieving universal electrical access will require innovation. It will not be possible to provide universal access just by expanding existing national electricity grids. Reaching rural areas with national grid lines can be very expensive, both to the provider and the customer, and delivers more power than many rural communities initially need. It's just not a well-matched technology for the rural poor. Furthermore, as more and more distributed renewable generation resources (think of rooftop solar panels) enter national grids, even countries with well-established grids are experiencing grid control and management issues. It doesn't make sense to build outdated and expensive infrastructure to power the rural poor, who more than anyone need future-ready, affordable, and sustainable energy to climb out of poverty. We have to consider a much broader range of electricity options to meet the needs of these communities. This includes renewable off-grid solutions, such as solar home systems and community micro-grids. In selecting and designing these technologies, the wind, solar, and hydro power generation potential of the community must be carefully considered. Battery technology must be specifically selected and sized to the local context. By carefully matching the technology to the community, we can build energy systems that bridge the gaps unmet by existing grids.
Evaluating all of the factors which determine the optimal electricity technology for a given community can be a lengthy and expensive process. It can include multiple site visits to survey and map the community, and subsequent analysis of the collected data. This level of specific analysis is needed to ensure a community-appropriate grid is designed; however, these methods make it too slow to meet the scale of electrifying nearly a billion people in the next ten years.
We are working on tools to accelerate the design process for community-appropriate rural electrical grids. By extracting accurate and up-to-date rural home locations from satellite imagery, we can minimize the duration, quantity, and intrusiveness of preliminary site visits. We can arrive in communities with an idea of which electrical distribution topologies may best suit their community layout. We can even have preliminary grid designs drafted to enable easier discussions with community members and leaders. You can see an example of how this might look in a sample of Bidi Bidi in Uganda below!
That's why we're finding rural homes in satellite imagery: using these images of rural homes, we can train computer vision algorithms to accurately find homes on a massive scale, and use this information to design better electrical grids. This can allow use to accelerate grid design for rural areas while still tailoring grid designs to community needs. In turn, this can help to provide the essential service of electricity and improve the quality of life of the world's poorest people.
Goal
We aim to improve the accuracy of home identification computer vision algorithms for use in rural contexts and electrification. Available training datasets of home images typically do not represent the rural housing styles present in sub-Saharan Africa. We are developing a training dataset of rural homes in sub-Saharan Africa to train an object detection algorithm. This will be used to find homes in georeferenced satellite imagery, providing home locations to be used in electrical design. This method will enable cheaper and easier electrical system planning at the community distribution level, thereby allowing better electrical system planning for increased energy access. All research outputs including algorithms and training datasets will be made available for further research. We envision these being used by researchers and policy-makers to do system-level grid planning and prioritisation of electrification work."

Anna Julia Cooper, noted educator, civil rights activist, and author of the classic 1892 text, A Voice from the South by a Black Woman of the South, earned her PhD at the age of 66 and challenged the Jim Crow educational system in Washington, D.C.
A distinguished member of Washington, D. C.'s African American community, Anna Julia Cooper rose to prominence as a leading scholar, educator, and civil rights activist. Born into slavery in 1858, she became the fourth African American woman to earn a doctoral degree when she received her PhD in history from the University of Paris-Sorbonne. In 1892 she penned one of the most forceful and enduring statements of black feminist thought to come of out of the nineteenth century, A Voice from the South by a Black Woman of the South, and she continued to write, work and publish until her death in 1964. In 1902 she waged what she refers to as the “courageous revolt” against Washington, DC’s segregated secondary curriculum, and continued to advocate for higher education for African Americans throughout her life. Through this project, we can begin to reconstruct the significance of Cooper’s writings and work which span from the end of Reconstruction to the dawning of the Civil Rights movement.
Join us in expanding access to Anna Julia Cooper's writings as we consider the broad sweep of national and local politics as reflected in one woman’s rich, but largely underappreciated archive.
Why engage with the materials?

As we make #CiteBlackWomen center to our critical praxis, we take the opportunity during the celebration of Douglass Day to call forth the genius of Anna Julia Cooper. By making her writings digitally accessible, we allow future generations of thinkers to recognize the significance of her work for a modern world.
Our crowd-based transcription of Anna Julia Cooper’s writings is a way to honor the collaborative and multimodal nature represented in Cooper’s own collection. This work of recovery and reclamation sees her scholarship as a part of a larger African American public history project with the potential to reshape our understanding of Black political thought at the dawn of the twenty-first century.
While her 1892 text, A Voice from the South, stands as a monument to Cooper’s intellectual contributions and thought, much of her writing remained unpublished in her lifetime and is underexamined in ours.

113;Jungle Weather;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/khufkens/jungle-weather/about/research;"Introduction
Our understanding of forest ecosystem and their response to climate change relies on consistent long-term observations which provide a baseline or reference. Yet, observing and measuring tropical plant species and the climatic (weather) conditions in which they reside is demanding, particularly in the central Congo Basin. Established long-term observation programs are therefore rare. In terms of meteorological observations, the central Congo Basin is currently represented by only a few rain gauges, limiting climate forecasts across the Congo Basin and the central African continent. This lack of long-term (historical) climatological data leaves the central Congo Basin spatially and temporally under-represented in both climatological and ecological (model) studies. However, old climate records could provide valuable information about previous growing conditions of the forest.
Large amounts of ecological and climatological data, approximately five decades (~1910 – 1960), exists as unexplored heritage, stored in various Belgian federal archives and collections. As part of a larger project called Congo Basin eco-climatological data recovery and valorization (COBECORE, www.cobecore.org) the ""Jungle Weather"" project will need your help transcribe historical climatological data as measured throughout the Congo Basin. Due to the large volumes of data and the limited options to automate transcription with optical character recognition (OCR) techniques your help is crucial in the full transcription of these historical records. Although various projects aim to improve the automation of transcription tasks, e.g. the European DARIAH project, to date, transcription of tables of handwritten data remains a challenge. The transcribed data therefore will give insight in the climate of the central African rainforest, will complement the completed Jungle Rhythms Zooniverse project, and contribute to machine learning training datasets in order to automate future transcription efforts.
The data
Within this project we will focus on data records as recorded throughout the tropical part of what is currently the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The area which we will cover is shown above in the map as an open polygon. The project will not cover the southern province of Katanga (red crosshatches) as this area transitions here from tropical to a humid subtropical climate.
The historical data is archived and stored in the Belgian State Archives. The Belgian State Archive harbour almost all data regarding colonial affairs, ranging from communications about trade to the raw data as digitized within the context of the Jungle Weathers project. Row upon row of data is stored in the basement. Below you see a part of the INEAC (Institut National pour l’Etude Agronomique du Congo belge) archive, which holds all climatological records.
These climatological records were noted rigorously on carbon copy paper. However, due to the hand written nature of the data (and the volume involved) automated processing is not possible. Although optical character recognition (OCR) works wonderfully on printed data the high variability in characters and the low contrast pencil markings contribute to the failure of current automated approaches. Similar to the Old Weather project and in spirit of the Jungle Rhythms project, a keen eye is required to decipher the numbers written down on these sheets.
Pre-Processing / digitization
The project will provide you, citizen scientists, with digital pictures of the original sheets. Scanning these climate data sheets was a laborious process. In total more than 70 000 records were digitized. Unlike the Old Weather project we do not require you to outline valid sections of the sheet. This part of the processing has been automated. Below you see an example of the automated machine learning (ML) based screening. A visualization of the screening results of one particular table are given below. The light blue pixels represent those of a template we use to figure out where valuable data is in the table, red/pink pixels represent those of the table data, blue pixels show agreement between the template and the matched table and, finally, white crosses indicate empty cells as predicted through ML.
As such, once digitized and properly aligned the whole record will be divided into an estimated 30 million cells. Of those a substantial number are empty. Only rows which are flagged as completely empty will be omitted from transcription. This routine saves a considerable amount of time and effort and lowers the number of actual values to transcribe to roughly 10 million cells.
The cells are padded so they might include some of their neighbours. This is needed to ensure that all data is included in case the hand written numbers do not stick to the nice layout of the table. As with all citizen science projects your feedback is essential in tracking strange cases and transcribing the correct data. In the below example you see that the data (on the bottom line) reads 10.1.
Machine Learning based transcription
In addition to data screening, data recovery will also rely on Machine Learning. Data will be transcribed in sections, using a subset of the complete dataset to provide training data for these automated algorithms. Despite the flexibility and power of these algorithms large training datasets are required to represent the variety of handwritten numbers in this large dataset.
Workflows
Two workflows will be provided, one workflow will cover the measurements, or the Transcribe Climate Data workflow. The Transcribe Meta-Data workflow will complement these data with additional information on the site's ID number, and month and year of observation. You are free to choose where to contribute. The meta-data workflow includes multiple steps and is probably less easy to execute on tablet or smartphone. Transcribing measurements from cells is easy and lends itself better to mobile device use."
114;Weather 100 - Eskdalemuir;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/malcolma1/weather-100-eskdalemuir/about/research;"Long-term meteorological observations are part of the irreplaceable cultural and scientific heritage of mankind that serve the needs of current and future generations for long-term high quality climate records. They are unique sources of past information about atmospheric parameters, thus are references for climate variability and change assessments. To highlight this importance, WMO has a mechanism to recognize centennial observing stations, Eskdalemuir Observatory in the Scottish Borders with continuous meteorological records spanning more than 100 years between 1910 and current day being one such site. By so doing, the WMO (World Meteorological Organisation) promotes sustainable observational standards and best practices that facilitate the generation of high-quality time series data
Whilst all recent and current data is stored electronically in the UK Climate database hosted by the Met Office, there are long periods that pre date the technological revolution where the data exists solely on the paper forms on which the observations were originally recorded.
An example of one such journal is shown below
The Eskdalemuir Observatory has paper climate records going back over 100 years but there are few records digitised pre 1950 . Our objective is to get climate data digitised to give continuous 100 year record which can aid climate modelling in future and help explain events in the past.
Over the period to be digitised three different types of daily journal and registers were used and it is copies of these journals which will need to be interpreted and classified .
In the first part of the project we will be asking volunteers to collect air pressure and temperature data covering a period from 1915-1923 when the small pocket book was used to record the observations
The completed data will be assimilated to climate models, greatly assisting with cutting edge climate predictions. Historic meteorological data is also required to put severe weather events into context and with potentially in excess of 100 years of digitised data from Eskdalemuir, trends and patterns will be identifiable to feed into a variety of planning purposes aligning with the Met Office purpose to help people stay safe and thrive.

115;The Koster seafloor observatory;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/victorav/the-koster-seafloor-observatory/about/research;"Join us and explore Sweden’s marine biodiversity.
On The Koster seafloor observatory we publish snapshots of deep-water recordings from the Kosterhavets National Park in Sweden.
About the study area
The Kosterhavets National Park is Sweden's first marine national park with a size of 389 square km. The area contains a highly diverse and unique marine ecosystem that is under active protection and management since 2009. Close to the bottom of the Koster-Väderö fjord the conditions are very similar to those in the open Atlantic Ocean. Here, sub-surface currents continuously transport larvae of deep oceanic species into the Koster fjord. As a result, there are many bottom dwelling species living here, which are otherwise only found in deep Atlantic waters. Large sponges, starfish and cold-water corals are some of them. You can see them in the photographs below.

Here is a map of Kosterhavets National Park. On the left hand side, you can see the location of the park. Actually, there are two national parks, on the Swedish side of the border is the Kosterhavet National Park, and on the Norwegian side, there is the Ytre Hvaler National Park. On the right hand side you can see the borders of the Kosterhavets National Park, its the archipelago, and the underwater seascape showing the deep water trench in dark blue. Map drawn by Hans Sjögren.
About the flora and fauna
Hidden under the sea in the Kosterhavet National Park you can find a rich and diverse underwater landscape: cliffs and deep valleys, dark clay sea beds, forests of seaweed and rocky reefs, shallow bays and narrow straits. The variation of habitats and ecosystems creates conditions for an unusually rich flora and fauna. With over 6000 different marine seaweeds and animals, Kosterhavets National Park is the most species-rich marine environment in Sweden.

The Common sunstar (Crossaster papposus) is a typical inhabitant of the seafloor in the National Park, photo Tomas Lundälv och Lisbeth Jonsson.

The Football sponge (Geodia sp.) is a large deep-sea species found in the boreal waters of the North Atlantic Ocean, and it is fairly common in the National Park.
About our research and the history of underwater filming
For the last 30 years, the scientists at the Tjärnö Marine Laboratory have used Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) and underwater cameras to monitor the area around the Kosterhavet National Park. The movies and images available to us today not only present an otherwise unseen part of the national park, they also can take us 30 years back in time. In our research we want to study how climate change and human activities influence the fauna in this area and which positive effects the protective status as national park had on the seafloor habitats.

This photo shows a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) that has been filming the study site since the mid 1990's. It generated a unique time series with more than 20 years of recordings from the seafloor in this area.
Acknowledgements
A large part of the movies has been recorded during biological inventories commissioned by the County Administrative Board of Västra Götaland. We are deeply grateful to the ROV-pilots and the database curators at Tjärnö Marine Laboratory (especially Tomas Lundälv, Lisbeth Jonsson, Roger A. Johansson, Lars-Ove Loo and Per Bergström), who maintained this collection for many years.
About the quality of underwater images and movies
Underwater images are usually of poor quality when compared with images and movies taken on land. This is because there is little natural light below 20 m (i.e. below the photic zone) and the water is very often turbid and filled with particles blurring the recordings. In addition, the camera may not stand still while filming because of the currents in the water. Together these factors often create fuzzy images and these conditions are almost impossible to control for. Hence, we must work with the image quality as is.
How can you help us?
In order to study the long-term changes on the sea floor and understand what effects the protection status of the park have, we need to analyse the species composition over time using the ROV footage. Do you want to help us? Great!"

117;Wild Mont-Blanc;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/crea-mont-blanc/wild-mont-blanc/about/research;"The project
Wild Mont-Blanc is a program developed by the Research Center for Alpine Ecosystems (CREA Mont-Blanc, a nonprofit research center based in Chamonix-Mont-Blanc, France) and initiated by ""Communauté de Communes de la Vallée de Chamonix-Mont-Blanc"". CREA Mont-Blanc is working to measure how climate change is impacting different alpine environments, and understand how alpine species can (or cannot) adapt to their changing environment. Wild Mont-Blanc provides an important contribution to this research, adding the monitoring of fauna to the CREA Mont-Blanc’s ongoing studies of vegetation and climate in the Mont-Blanc massif.
This project was financed by ""Agence de l'environnement et de la maîtrise de l'énergie - Programme d'Investissements d'Avenir"" and by ""Communauté de Communes de la Vallée de Chamonix-Mont-Blanc"".

Our camera traps are installed every 200 meters along an elevation gradient, allowing us to observe all of the different natural environments found in the Mont-Blanc massif (forest, shrubland, grassland, moraine).
Why this project ?
It is especially challenging to study changes in the abundance or activity of animals (mammals and birds) in hard-to-access mountain terrain. It’s also difficult to count animals that are constantly moving around vast habitats. Camera traps are powerful tools allowing us to monitor animal activity with an easily repeatable protocol. Beginning in 2018, CREA Mont-Blanc installed a network of 40 camera traps between 1,300 and 2,700 meters of elevation on the different aspects of Mont-Blanc, creating a network that helps us analyze seasonal variations in the ways that different species use their habitats. The cameras allow us to collect data on altitudinal migration, rhythm of activity, feeding behavior, and molting dates. Identifying the species observed in the photos also helps us improve an automated system of photo analysis that will allow us to analyze a huge number of photos over the long term.
The Mont-Blanc Massif
The Mont-Blanc massif is located in the heart of the Alps, at the crossroads of France, Italy and Switzerland. With its exceptional relief, it offers a diversity of climatic conditions and ecosystems spanning more than 4,500 m of elevation, making it a unique laboratory for the study of mountain ecosystems. Since the beginning of the 20th century, the Alps have experienced temperature increases at twice the rate of the rest of the Northern Hemisphere. As a result, the Mont-Blanc massif is also a remarkable study site for understanding how mountain ecosystems are responding to climate change.
Scientific questions
Wild Mont-Blanc will help us answer the following questions:
How do alpine species adapt to changes in their environment? Are animals changing where they go and how they use different habitats? If so, which species? And in which seasons? Does this have an impact on vegetation?
Can we observe long-term changes in the abundance of different species? With climate change, which species are winners and which are losers?
How do decreases in snow cover duration impact alpine species (particularly for species like mountain hare, ermine and rock ptarmigan that change color in winter and summer)? Are these species able to adapt and change their camouflage strategy by modifying their molting dates or behavior?

We need your help
Help us improve our understanding of how climate change is impacting alpine species. The Wild Mont-Blanc project will allow you to observe emblematic species like chamois, ibex, marmot, snowshoe hare, deer, roe deer, alpine ptarmigan, and black grouse throughout the year and in all different climatic conditions from the base of the valley up to the high mountains."
118;Vintage Cuban Radio;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/ucla-idep/vintage-cuban-radio/about/research;"About the collection
Universidad del Aire (University on the Air) was an educational radio program that began airing on Radio CMQ in Havana, Cuba in 1948 during the presidency of Carlos Prío Socarras and later during the US-backed dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista up through 1963, the initial years of the Cuban Revolution led by Fidel Castro. This didactic radio show featured lectures by prominent Cuban intellectuals and cultural figures (i.e. Alejo Carpentier, Nicolás Guillen, José Lezama Lima, Jorge Mañach) on a wide variety of themes from art, history, politics and music. The program was recorded live by the radio station on lacquer discs and accompanied by a published cuaderno (notebook) on the discussed topics. The topics discussed and live audience question and answer sessions recorded on Universidad del Aire provide unique insight into the social and political tensions in pre and post-revolutionary Cuba.
The only known recordings of Universidad del Aire are held by the Institute of Cuban History (IHC) based in Havana, Cuba. The Universidad del Aire recordings are extremely fragile and were digitized from lacquer discs in 2017-2018 through a collaboration between UCLA Library and the IHC as part of the International Digital Ephemera Project. (Read more about the preservation and digitization process here.) These recordings have never been accessible to researchers and offer new opportunities for scholarship.
View / listen to the Universidad del Aire collection
About the project
We want to create tables of contents and full-text transcriptions for the Universidad del Aire radio recordings to enable deep engagement with the audio material as well as promote re-use of the collection for computationally driven research and teaching. We are asking volunteers to identify speaker's voices, ads, and music which will help us create a table of contents for the program (no Spanish required for this task). Volunteers can also transcribe segments in Spanish. Creating full-text transcriptions will also open up the collection to a wider audience, such as researchers with reading knowledge of Spanish but not strong aural comprehension. Creating full-text transcripts will also enable us to identify if there are segments that should be prioritized for translation into English.
Who will use the collection
The collection would be of interest to researchers working in the disciplines of Latin American Studies, Caribbean Studies, Spanish & Portuguese, history, anthropology, music, literature, and sound studies. Based on preliminary listens of the collection, some potential research areas could be connections between African diaspora intellectuals, Afrocuban history and relations, censorship in Cuba, Cuban poetry and literature, Cuban rumba music, Latin American solidarity and regional identity. The collection would also be of interest to radio and sound historians and Spanish language learners."

The Screen Arts Mavericks & Makers Collection at the University of Michigan Library preserves 1,344 letters sent to the New York City office of Orson Welles’s Mercury Theatre in the aftermath of the broadcast, which were kept by one of Welles’s producing partners and largely forgotten for seventy years. Increased public interest in these letters, following their being featured in a 2013 PBS documentary and the 2015 book Broadcast Hysteria, inspired our initiative to create a digital archive making them more accessible to scholars and students. Not only do these letters offer a unique window into early American radio broadcasting and reception by documenting how audiences reacted to one of the most important programs in the medium’s history; they also present an opportunity to make radio history come alive by using the full story of War of the Worlds to address issues of media misinformation and “fake news” particularly relevant to our present moment.
Our project makes the War of the Worlds letters—and the many personal stories they contain—digitally available to researchers and the general public, fully searchable by city, state, and transcribed text. The digital database will also include vetted lesson plans we created in collaboration with several teachers and schools in Southeast Michigan to help teach an array of subjects aimed at middle school, high school, and community college students. Together, these resources make the letters the intellectual center for lessons about American political and media history before World War II, fact-checking and news bias and reliability, radio performance, and English."

Sagehen Creek Field Station is a research and teaching facility of the University of California at Berkeley. We are embedded within the Sagehen Experimental Forest, a 9000-acre headwater basin of the Truckee River, located north of Truckee, CA in the central Sierra Nevada.
Sagehen was started in 1951 specifically for fisheries and wildlife studies. Today, our research and education portfolio has expanded to include kid's programs, art, hydrology, forest health and much more, but wildlife biology is still a big emphasis here.
Much of what we know about wild trout was learned at Sagehen in the 1950's and 1960's. American marten have been studied and monitored in the basin since 1979; in fact, the first wolverine documented in California since 1922 showed up on a marten researcher's camera trap at Sagehen in 2008, and he has been photographed by camera traps in the area every year since. The Highway-89 Stewardship Team is using camera traps to discover how wildlife interacts with the highway that runs through the lower Sagehen basin. Researchers from the University of Nevada - Reno have studied cognition in Mountain Chickadees at Sagehen for over 20 years, discovering some amazing things about bird brains. Biologists have been tracking migratory bird productivity and survivorship at Sagehen since 1992, and monitoring bird response to the catastrophic Donner Ridge fire since 1960. And an iNaturalist volunteer documented the first otter ever recorded in the basin just last year...after almost 70 years of people looking in every corner of the basin. Amazing what's still out there, waiting to be uncovered!
The American Marten is a long-studied indicator species at Sagehen that lets us know how the system is doing: since the martens are at the top of the food chain, if they are happy that means that a lot of other things must be, too. You might even find one of these cute little guys in the photos.
You could help us make the next big discovery!
After you identify what's in the pictures, we can use a special algorithm with these un-baited camera trap photos to get population estimates of various wildlife species over time, learning how they use the landscape and how their populations respond to forest health treatments. We are expecting wildlife to benefit greatly--that's one of the big goals of our Sagehen Forest Project!

In the 1970s there were around 5500 rain gauges in the UK - that means you would not have been more than a couple of miles from one! Nowadays there are around 2500 which is still enough to map out variations in rainfall from month to month.
But, when we look at the number of rainfall records, it seems as though there were only a few hundred rain gauges before 1961. So what's going on?
The problem is that before 1961 there were actually thousands of rain gauges but the data has not been transferred from the original hand-written paper records to something digital so that we can use it.
This is where we need your help!
This project aims to fill in the gaps in our historical rainfall observation network. You will be shown images of rainfall data that have not yet been digitised and asked to transcribe the values and locations.
The aim is to better understand wet, dry and normal periods in our history and help water companies plan for every eventuality. For example, October 1903 was wet. Very wet. Wetter than any month we know about.
We think that October 1903 was much wetter overall than February 2020, which caused so much flooding in the UK. But it was not wetter everywhere and our existing observations are far fewer. More data will help us map out the variations with much greater precision. Other years such as 1921 and periods in the 1880s and 1890s were very dry and we need to understand why.

123;University of Wyoming Raccoon Project;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/trouille/university-of-wyoming-raccoon-project/about/research;"About the University of Wyoming Raccoon Project
As the human population continues to grow, urbanization of the land is expected to grow as well. Although many species around the globe are in currently in decline due to urbanization, we see that some species not only survive, but actually thrive in urban habitats. Animals like raccoons have demonstrated an incredible ability to adapt to new environments, including cities, and are expanding their range into new areas where they have not existed previously. Raccoons use the cover of darkness to explore human environments and are experts at exploiting human refuse, earning them the affectionate title of ""trash pandas"". They are well-known for many of their iconic physical traits, such as their dexterous forepaws, ringed tail, and bandit-like mask. Raccoons also have a reputation for being intelligent, which likely aids them in their successful conquest of human environments. Interestingly however, raccoons have been largely overlooked in the field of animal cognition, likely because of the difficulty involved in studying these nocturnal, cunning animals.
The University of Wyoming Raccoon Project was established in 2015 to better understand raccoons and their cognition, especially their ability to learn independently or from others, their ability to innovate solutions to new problems, and their ability to behave flexibly. We design various cognitive challenges, or ""puzzles"", for wild raccoons and study how they approach and solve these challenges. We use a variety of high-tech equipment and new experimental methods to conduct our trials at night without the involvement of human experimenters. We also conduct comparative research with other successful urban carnivores, such as striped skunks and coyotes.
About Our Experiment
These videos were collected during an experiment on the learning, problem-solving, and social behavior of free-ranging raccoons and skunks in the town of Laramie, Wyoming. We set up the experiment at night, when raccoons and skunks are most active. Below is a list of the equipment we used that you may be curious about.
Puzzle Box

A puzzle box is an apparatus an animal must figure out how to open in order to get a food reward. The puzzle box you see in the videos has 12 doors on each side, and behind each door is a small amount of sardines and dog kibble (a tasty treat for animals like raccoons and skunks!). We are able to measure the learning and problem-solving skills of animals in the videos by measuring (1) the amount of time it takes the animal to open each door and (2) the diversity of behaviors they use to open the doors. We also record other items of interest, such as social behaviors.
Night Vision Cameras

We set up four infrared (or ""night vision"") cameras around the puzzle box to record trials. Like us, the animals in the videos cannot see this light.
PIT tag reader

Every year the UWRP humanely traps, identifies, and releases raccoons and skunks as a part of our research. Each animal we trap is marked with a passive integrated transponder tag (""PIT tag,"" like a microchip used with pets). We place a PIT tag reader at our study site, and the reader scans and records the PIT tag number of the animals that come to the puzzle box. This way, we can match up the PIT tag records to our camera footage to find out who is who!
Ear Tags

Many of the raccoons and skunks also receive ear tags for visual identification.
Radio Collars

A subset of raccoons in our study population have been fitted with very high frequency (VHF) radio collars. We use VHF telemetry to detect the signal emitted from the collars and find the location of the raccoons after we have released them. We use this information to better understand the movement and home range size of raccoons in the town of Laramie. The majority of raccoon tracking is performed by University of Wyoming undergraduate students that are building skills for a future career in wildlife biology and management.
About the aims of our Citizen Science Project
The overall goal of this project is to gather data that will allow us to train a machine learning algorithm to distinguish between individual raccoons. We want to be able to say whether the raccoon in a video is Alice the raccoon or Bob the raccoon based on the video data alone. To get there, we need to be able to determine a few things about each video
how many animals are in a video,
where they appear in the frame,
what species each animal in the video is,
the individual identity of each of the animals in the video.
We could ask each of these questions in separate citizen science projects. However, by gathering the bounding box data for each frame in a video, we are gathering the data required to address the first three points. We will aim to use the data you provide to train a machine learning algorithm to automatically draw bounding boxes and identify the species in each box. It will take a lot of training data for the algorithm to learn to do this and it will be an iterative process. As you annotate more and more images, we will use these to improve the algorithm, allowing you to focus attention on the data that we need the most help with. For example, as the algorithm improves we should be able to remove more of the images that do not contain any animals allowing you to focus on those that do.
Once we have a reliable algorithm that can draw a box around each animal in an image and identify its species, we can link the PIT tags to the raccoons in the bounding boxes (addressing point 4. above). While this should be easy for videos with one or two raccoons, it will be a lot trickier when there are many raccoons. We might need your help again in the future to deal with these situations in order to track raccoons between frames or even identify who each of the raccoons is.
We hope to use what we learn from this work to help us identify individuals in other camera trap projects. This will allow ecologists to more accurately estimate populations of animals and enhance the study of wild animal behavior and personality."
124;Power to the People;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/alycialeonard/power-to-the-people/about/research;"About the project
Power to the People is finding rural homes in sub-Saharan Africa using satellite imagery to expand electrical access. To design electrical systems that meet the needs and desires of specific communities, we need detailed information about the places they call home.
Motivation
Close to 1 billion people live without electricity worldwide. Most live in sub-Saharan Africa or South Asia. The vast majority live in rural areas.
Electricity improves and saves lives. It allows for better healthcare through medical technologies. Electric night-time lighting allows for study and alleviates gendered safety issues. Electric cooking reduces harmful smoke and particulate exposure driven by fuel-burning cook-stoves. Productive uses of electricity, from electric grinding mills to sewing machines and refrigeration, can grow local businesses and alleviate poverty. There are so many ways electricity can improve livelihoods.
Our team is driven by the by the seventh United Nations Sustainable Development Goal, which calls for universal access to reliable and sustainable electricity by 2030. We want everyone to have access to electricity; in our modern, technology-driven world, electricity is essential in ensuring equal opportunity to thrive.
Achieving universal electrical access will require innovation. It will not be possible to provide universal access just by expanding existing national electricity grids. Reaching rural areas with national grid lines can be very expensive, both to the provider and the customer, and delivers more power than many rural communities initially need. It's just not a well-matched technology for the rural poor. Furthermore, as more and more distributed renewable generation resources (think of rooftop solar panels) enter national grids, even countries with well-established grids are experiencing grid control and management issues. It doesn't make sense to build outdated and expensive infrastructure to power the rural poor, who more than anyone need future-ready, affordable, and sustainable energy to climb out of poverty. We have to consider a much broader range of electricity options to meet the needs of these communities. This includes renewable off-grid solutions, such as solar home systems and community micro-grids. In selecting and designing these technologies, the wind, solar, and hydro power generation potential of the community must be carefully considered. Battery technology must be specifically selected and sized to the local context. By carefully matching the technology to the community, we can build energy systems that bridge the gaps unmet by existing grids.
Evaluating all of the factors which determine the optimal electricity technology for a given community can be a lengthy and expensive process. It can include multiple site visits to survey and map the community, and subsequent analysis of the collected data. This level of specific analysis is needed to ensure a community-appropriate grid is designed; however, these methods make it too slow to meet the scale of electrifying nearly a billion people in the next ten years.
We are working on tools to accelerate the design process for community-appropriate rural electrical grids. By extracting accurate and up-to-date rural home locations from satellite imagery, we can minimize the duration, quantity, and intrusiveness of preliminary site visits. We can arrive in communities with an idea of which electrical distribution topologies may best suit their community layout. We can even have preliminary grid designs drafted to enable easier discussions with community members and leaders. You can see an example of how this might look in a sample of Bidi Bidi in Uganda below!
That's why we're finding rural homes in satellite imagery: using these images of rural homes, we can train computer vision algorithms to accurately find homes on a massive scale, and use this information to design better electrical grids. This can allow use to accelerate grid design for rural areas while still tailoring grid designs to community needs. In turn, this can help to provide the essential service of electricity and improve the quality of life of the world's poorest people.
Goal
We aim to improve the accuracy of home identification computer vision algorithms for use in rural contexts and electrification. Available training datasets of home images typically do not represent the rural housing styles present in sub-Saharan Africa. We are developing a training dataset of rural homes in sub-Saharan Africa to train an object detection algorithm. This will be used to find homes in georeferenced satellite imagery, providing home locations to be used in electrical design. This method will enable cheaper and easier electrical system planning at the community distribution level, thereby allowing better electrical system planning for increased energy access. All research outputs including algorithms and training datasets will be made available for further research. We envision these being used by researchers and policy-makers to do system-level grid planning and prioritisation of electrification work."

Somkhanda Game Reserve is a community-owned reserve, aiming to restore 16,000 hectares into a vibrant wildlife habitat for wildlife conservation. Situated in Northern Zululand, this 12,000 hectare community-owned game reserve forms part of an important conservation corridor between the Manyoni Private Game Reserve and Pongola Game Reserve, particularly for the endangered black rhino and wild dog. Somkhanda is home to white and black rhino, impala, greater kudu, giraffe, and an extraordinarily high density of leopard compared to any other reserve in Africa.
The establishment of Somkhanda Game Reserve has come about through the consolidation of a number of privately owned properties that were awarded to the Gumbi Community through South African’s land restitution process. As a result of the far sighted leadership of the Gumbi community, the support of Wildlands Conservation Trust, World Wildlife Fund, KZN Wildlife, and African Insight, 12,000 hectares of prime Zululand bushveld is now dedicated to wildlife conservation and eco-tourism.
Updates!
Eleven elephants were recently introduced to the reserve. Look for our first elephant sightings on the Safari cams!

Welcome to Planet Hunters TESS. With your help, we can discover new planets around stars outside of our own Solar System!
The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is providing us with a huge amount of data that lets us look for planets outside of our own Solar System. Over the next two years TESS will be busy surveying two-hundred-thousand bright nearby stars, measuring and recording their brightness every two minutes. With your help, we hope to uncover lots of interesting planetary systems, allowing us to explore the formation and evolution of these worlds. Our findings may even bring us one step closer to answering the question that we all seek to answer: Are we alone in the Universe?
You could be the first person to discover a planet around a nearby star in the Milky Way! Want to give it a try?
What is an Exoplanet?
Photo credits: Nora Eisner (star adapted from NASA image)
Exoplanets are planets beyond our own Solar System that orbit stars other than the Sun. The drastic improvement in telescopes in the last 50 years has enabled us to find thousands of exoplanets since the first one was discovered in the late 20th century. Whilst many of these found exoplanets resemble the planets found in the Solar System, we have also come across strange systems including gigantic planets in orbits close to their star (called Hot Jupiters) and planets that orbit multiple stars (circumbinary planets).
How do we detect Planets?
It is extremely difficult to see exoplanets directly, even with the largest telescopes. This is because the planets are hidden in the bright light given off by their host star. Instead, we can infer their presence by monitoring the starlight.
TESS records how the brightness of individual stars varies over time. This time series of brightness measurements is known as a lightcurve. When an exoplanet passes, or transits, in front of its host star, the star momentarily dims and we see a dip in its lightcurve. This method of detecting planets is known as the Transit Method and has already proven to be extremely effective.
Here is a simplified example of what the lightcurve from a transit looks like. It shows that as the planet passes in front of its host star, the light that we receive decreases.
Photo credits: Nora Eisner
In order for us to be able to observe a transit we require the planetary system to be oriented so that the planet passes between us and the host star (as shown on the right hand side of the image below). If this is the case, we will see a dip every time that the planet completes one full orbit around the star. If the planet does not cross our line of sight, we will miss the transit (shown on the left).
Photo credits: Nora Eisner
The size of the dip in the lightcurve depends both on the size of the star and on the size of the planet. First, for a single sized star, if the transiting planet is larger it will block out more starlight, and thus the dip in the lightcurve will be larger. Conversely, for the same sized planet, if the star is larger (for example a G dwarf like the Sun) the transit will be shallower than if the star is smaller (for example an M dwarf).
Photo credits: Nora Eisner
The depths of transits can vary greatly. Jupiter, the largest planet in our Solar System, has a transit depth of about 1% when it passes in front of the Sun. Earth, however, is a much smaller planet and only blocks out 0.01% of the light when it transits the Sun! The numbers on the vertical axis of the lightcurve plots shown in the project represent the percentage decrease in light with respect to the average light given off by the star. With knowledge of the transit depth and the size of the star, we can work out the size of the planet using this equation:
In our Solar System we have eight various sized planets. It therefore should come as no surprise that other stars can also host multiple worlds. The lightcurves of such exoplanetary-systems show multiple transits from the different planets, which are likely to have different depths due to their different sizes. They are also likely to be separated irregularly, as different planets orbit around stars at different rates - just like the planets in our Solar System (Jupiter takes 12 times longer than Earth to complete one orbit). An example lightcurve is shown below. If you see a multi-planet system, please highlight all the transits that you see.
A well studied multi-planet system is Trappist-1, which has seven planets orbiting around a star 100 trillion kilometers away from Earth. The fact that we can see the Trappist planets is incredible. To put this into perspective, seeing the Trappist-1 transits is equivalent to us detecting a fruit fly passing just in front of a car headlamp that is located over half way between us and the moon. But we can do it!

Stars
The vast majority of stars are not alone, but instead exist in double, or even triple systems of stars that orbit around one another. When one of these stars passes in front of another (as seen by us), the brightness that we observe changes, similar to what happens during a planet transit. This is known as an eclipsing binary. Lightcurves due to an eclipsing binary will often exhibit two different sized dips.
If you do see a lightcurve with an eclipsing binary, please mark this as a transit and tell us about it in Talk.
Stellar Variability
To complicate things further, we also see changes in brightness due to the variability of the star. Stars have starspots just as the Sun has sunspots, and as they rotate with the star they result in periodic fluctuations in the observed brightness. These variations tend to be slow and smooth, typically occurring over a couple of days. Conversely, we expect planets to transit at a much quicker pace, in just a few to tens of hours, resulting in narrower dips in the lightcurves.
Stars can also pulsate. This is when the radius of the star changes over time, and thus the brightness fluctuates. This effect ranges from being very rapid, on the timescales of a few hours, to extremely low, on the timescale of years.

TESS launched on April 18, 2018, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, and now orbits around the Earth at twice the rate of the Moon. Over the next two years, this amazing new satellite will observe the entire sky by breaking it up into 26 different sectors. Each sector is stared at by four extremely powerful cameras, together covering a patch of sky with dimensions of 24 by 96 degrees. You can find out exactly where the satellite is pointing at in link. The stars in each of these sectors will be monitored for at least 27 days, recording their brightness every 2 minutes.

Watch this video to find out more about how TESS works:
Systematic Effects
TESS is great, but no system is perfect, so there are some systematic effects that can be seen around the same time in multiple lightcurves. One of these is around 22 days to 24 days, and often shows up as increasingly scattered data points, or a sudden jump in the lightcurve. We can see these in the Sector 1 data, but they might disappear in later data releases. Here is an example:
.
Each time the satellite downlinks data to Earth, which happens around the 14-day mark halfway through each observing run, and lasts about 4 hours, the conditions of the satellite can change slightly - e.g. due to changes in temperature of the equipment. This may result in a brief glitch in the data, which we are calling a focus event. This can show up in the lightcurves as highlighted in the figure below.
Simulated Data
One of our primary goals from the Planet Hunters TESS project is to find out more about the diversity of planets, and to understand what kind of solar systems exist. We will find many planetary systems with Planet Hunters TESS, but in order to correctly interpret our results we need to understand how complete our sample is. For example, very small planets are very difficult to find and we might not see any in the TESS data, but this does not mean that they do not exist.
In order to determine what kind of planets we can and can't find with Planet Hunters TESS, we occasionally show you a simulated lightcurve. As it is simulated, we know all the parameters of the lightcurve, including the depth of the transit, the orbital period of the planet, and the variability of the star. The results from the simulated data are essential for defining the completeness of our planets as a function of size (depth of the transit event) and the orbital period (number of transits). This is a crucial part of the project that allows us to answer some of the most interesting and fundamental questions of how planets and solar systems form.
Please remember that we are not testing you or trying to train you; we are testing the system in order to allow us to correctly interpret all of your classifications. We will always tell you when you encounter a simulation after you classified it - we tell you that it's a simulation after, and not before, to ensure that no bias is introduced. Simulations also gives us a chance to give you some feedback on your classification. You will get many classifications right so please don't be discouraged if you missed some transits, some simulated transits are purposely very difficult to spot, and that result will help us analyse the overall results.
The feedback will look like the image below, where a green column means you correctly marked a transit, and a red columns means that you missed one. Sometimes the transits are so small that they are impossible to see, this happens when the planet is very small compared to the host star. The variability of the star will also make them increasingly more difficult to see. The number of simulations that you see will decrease as you do more classifications.
Why we need you
Scientists from around the world have developed extremely efficient computer algorithms that will look for repeated signals in TESS's lightcurves. Such techniques have already proven to be extremely efficient at finding planets, however there is only so much that a machine can do. Planetary systems are highly complex, and their lightcurves are never quite the same. This, combined with the variability of the stars, can confuse our computer algorithms, yielding wrong results or missing planetary systems entirely. Human brains, however, are excellent at detecting patterns that automated routines may miss, and that is why we need your help!
To date, Planet Hunters volunteers found over 100 new planetary systems in data from TESS's predecessor, Kepler, and we are excited to find even more with the TESS data. Will the next planet be discovered by you?"

130;Run, Herring, Run!;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/jllopiz/run-herring-run/about/research;"Our Research
Thanks for coming along in our journey — and theirs!
What are we doing?
We are trying to better understand when, why, and how baby river herring make their annual journey from freshwater to the ocean. This journey is called ""emigration"". River herring are anadromous fishes, which means they were born in fresh waters (like lakes and ponds), spend a few months growing up in these lakes and ponds, and will then head to sea. They will spend 3-5 years growing up in the ocean and then return to their home ponds to find their mates. You can trace the river herring life cycle in the cartoon above. There has been very little research on when juvenile river herring start their seaward journey, but this information is important to river herring conservation efforts. To learn more we installed a camera to film this migration and we need your help to count all the baby fish as they travel.
Why should you care about river herring??
River herring refers two species, blueback herring and alewife. Known as the “fish that feeds all,” river herring have been a valued food source for Native Americans for centuries and were historically commercially harvested as food sources, bait, fish meal, and pet food. Also, river herring are a food source for many marine and freshwater predators (e.g. striped bass, cod, porpoises, seabirds) and transport nutrients between marine and freshwater systems. Unfortunately, river herring have experienced centuries-long population declines related, in part, to human stressors like dams, habitat degradation, overfishing, and being caught accidentally as bycatch in other fisheries. Population declines prompted listing of alewife and blueback herring as Species of Concern by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and harvest restrictions in several states. In 2011, a petition for the inclusion of river herring in the Endangered Species Act (ESA) was not accepted, partly due to inadequate data on the freshwater portion of the river herring life cycle. We hope our work and your contributions to it will help bridge that gap to support conservation efforts.
So, what are you doing?
You will he helping us count fish in frames of our videos of juvenile emigration. We need to figure out how many juvenile river herring leave a given freshwater system, and what determines when they head to sea. This is the first study to continuously film the juveniles as they emigrate, which happens over a 7 month period! That's a lot of videos to watch, and your help is critical for our research! We will then compare juvenile numbers to different environmental conditions like water quality, weather, moon cycles, food availability, and flow rates to figure out what might trigger baby river herring to leave freshwater ponds.
Where is the research being conducted?
Our camera is in the Monument River near the Cape Cod Canal in Massachusetts. The baby herring grew up in Great Herring Pond before they decided to head to sea. The camera is at a very narrow point in the river where we can see across the entire width of the river and right before the fish spill over one of the many 'steps' (little waterfalls) along the river.
Our video location: the Herring Run Motel. The camera is under the board that provides shade, thereby reducing the day/night difference in light levels.
A closeup of our video setup. The camera is on the far side on the right, the infrared light is on the far side on the left, and the black backdrop is on the near side of the river. The video is recorded by a laptop inside the box in the background, and a phone inside the box allows the computer to connect to the internet (via a hotspot) to allow the system to be monitored remotely. The hotel's owner has graciously provided electricity to run the system.
An example frame from our videos. Since we're only interested in whether a fish passes by, we made the dimensions of the frames tall and narrow to minimize file sizes.
How can you help?
All you have to do is put a point on every river herring you see in an image. Since most everything is a herring, if you see a blurry fish, it's likely a herring, so mark it. Some video was taken at night, when we had an infrared light shining. In most of the images you'll see a lot of black and usually just light spots (rarely the entire fish). Mark all the light spots––these are herring too."

This study will investigate how the structure and abundance of mammal communities, influenced by natural as well as anthropogenic processes, affects mammal species diversity and assemblages.
In response to the urgent need for more accurate assessment of mammal occupancy and populations we are launching a new research project called Snapshot Safari – South Africa as a continuation of Snapshot Safari – Serengeti, where citizen scientists worldwide helped to classify millions of photographs collected by a network of camera traps in Tanzania’s Serengeti National Park.
Snapshot Safari – South Africa will include an unprecedented network of camera trap grids in dozens of protected areas and protected area expansion areas in South Africa to provide continuous monitoring of population sizes and trends of all the larger (>10 kg) mammal species at each site. Some of the participating study areas are managed as conservancies and stewardship areas, some are privately owned, some are state-run, and others are under communal tenure. With the help of accurate camera trap censuses, and innovative mapping approaches we will be able to identify which sites are being managed successfully - and hence which conservation strategies should be incorporated into a toolbox for effective wildlife management.
Snapshot Safari – South Africa will enable us to closely examine questions of species occupancy, species coexistence, competition, trophic interactions, the effect of change, and other ecological relationships across a variety of habitat types, community compositions, and management strategies.

135;Ensemble@Yale;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/haasarts/ensemble-at-yale/about/research;"The Project
What is the most-produced play at Yale? Who starred with Lupita Nyong'o, Meryl Streep, and Paul Giamatti when they were students? Ensemble@Yale is an experiment that aims to answer these questions and more by transforming historical theater programs from Yale’s archives into searchable text through crowdsourced transcription. Rather than reproducing all of the words in a digitized document, as with optical character recognition (OCR), crowdsourced transcription relies on human judgment to create structured data and identify features of interest to scholars and theater enthusiasts.
Inspired by the original Ensemble project from NYPL Labs, Ensemble@Yale was initially based on the Scribe Project from NYPL Labs and Zooniverse. Ensemble@Yale switched platforms in summer 2019 from Scribe to Zooniverse’s Project Builder, streamlining workflows to focus on cast and staff and give volunteers a way to track their contributions. The Ensemble site provides the opportunity to browse programs from throughout Yale’s theater history, and links out to the Zooniverse project where you and other volunteers can help transcribe the era we are working on.
The Programs
Internationally recognized as a leading training program, the Yale School of Drama is and its professional company, Yale Repertory Theatre, has premiered numerous plays that have gone on to successful productions in New York and elsewhere. The long list of renowned alumni has garnered significant research interest in the archival records of their careers at Yale; however the materiality of these records makes them difficult to comprehensively search. Yale University Library’s archives of productions on campus, dating back to 1925, are housed in several separate special collections units. The vast majority of these records exist solely in print and often lack intuitive access for researchers. Ensemble@Yale will provide new entry points into the collection emphasizing the people behind the productions.
To facilitate quick browsing, the programs on this site are organized into six historical eras that are important to Yale’s theater history (for more details, see the FAQ). On Zooniverse, only one era of programs is available for transcribing at a time. Once that era is complete, we will move to the next chronologically.
How You Can Get Involved
We can’t unlock Yale’s theater history without your help! Transcribing for this project entails identifying people involved in a production (cast or staff members depending on the task) and then typing exactly what you see. Anyone can pitch in from anywhere by clicking Classify in the Zooniverse project. Once there, you will see a tutorial teaching you how to transcribe from our digitized historical programs.
We have a talk board if you find anything you want to share or have program-specific questions for us! If you’re local to New Haven, we also have a series of events that are free and open to the public. More information is available on the DHLab events calendar and Haas Arts Library Facebook, or you can sign up for our mailing list to receive updates: email arts.library@yale.edu with the subject ""Subscribe for Ensemble@Yale updates!”

These specimens include plants on sheets, fish in jars, insects on pins, fossils in drawers, and more. Each specimen image seen by participants should include an accompanying label that uses a word that the collection community previously recognized as being used to document anomalies (e.g., “early”, “late”, “odd”, “weird”, “than”; Pearson and Mast, 2019, American Journal of Botany). The next step after this is to build machine learning algorithms to flag records likely to contain an observation of a biological anomaly to get this information to the researchers, conservation biologists, natural resource managers, and others who could use it. But to do this, we need to present the software with training data that has many examples of language that does and does not contain observations of anomalies. Building that training set is the goal of How Weird is That?"
137;Plankton Portal;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/kelseyswieca/plankton-portal/about/research;"A few words about plankton
Plankton comes from the Greek word planktos meaning “wanderer” or “drifter”. As a group, plankton are an eclectic collection of organisms adrift in the oceanic waters. The classification of an organism as ‘plankton’ has nothing to do with its biological grouping, but rather with its inability to swim actively against oceanic currents.
Plankton vary widely in size from thousandths of an inch (0.05 mm) or less to several feet in length (> 1m) or more. Most are less than an inch (~ 2.5 cm). Some organisms spend all their life as plankton and drift along with the ocean currents, while others are only temporary passive passengers until they reach a certain size and age, allowing for movement in the open ocean or settlement into a coastal habitat.
There are two main types of plankton: phytoplankton (plants) and zooplankton (animals). We are most interested in the zooplankton because our underwater camera system is optimized to capture the image of larger planktonic organisms, ranging from a few mm to a few centimeters which includes a wide variety of different organisms.
Why study plankton?
Planktonic organisms are critically important food source to the all ocean. Small phytoplankton form the beginning of the food supply which are consumed by larger plankton, then those plankton by larger organisms all the way up to fish and the largest species of whales found in the sea. No plankton: no life in the ocean.
Plankton also play an important role in the global carbon cycle capturing the sun’s energy and the atmosphere’s CO2 at the surface of the ocean and releasing it, via the above food chain, to other organisms and other areas of the ocean from shallow coastal areas to the deep ocean basins.
Understanding where and when plankton occur at different depths in the ocean allows scientists to get a global understanding of the function and health of the ocean from small to global scales.
Plankton are also fascinating in their diversity of intricate and beautiful shapes. The weightlessness of life in the ocean environment allows for very delicate and complex body designs, which are almost impossible to keep intact with normal means of collection. Imaging systems provide a first glimpse of these amazing animals in their natural environment, and may even lead to discovery of new species.
How do we get the images?
The In Situ Ichthyoplankton Imaging System (ISIIS) is one of a few systems in the world capable of improving the way we study plankton to better understand their life and function in the marine environment. ISIIS is, in some ways, a “virtual net” which captures the images of the organisms and information about their immediate surroundings. By sampling continuously, the result is a collection of digital images that record the exact location of the various plankton organisms in relation to each other and the environment in which they live. Further, the images are recorded onto a simple hard drive instead of slurry of plankton all mixed together in a sample jar with formaldehyde (yech!).
ISIIS is composed of a macro-camera system with its own illumination and is integrated into an underwater vehicle with a variety of additional sensors to measure the depth, salinity and temperature of the water, as well as such properties as dissolved oxygen, light level, and even how much chlorophyll a (measure of primary production) is present. Together, the camera and sensors provide detailed profiles and tracks of what plankton are where and what the ocean environment around them is like."
138;Eye for Diabetes;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/oogvoordiabetes/eye-for-diabetes/about/research;"Detecting early signs of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) in retina images
Diabetes
Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough —or any— insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause health problems. Although diabetes has no cure, you can take steps to manage your sugar levels and stay healthy.
Diabetic retinopathy
Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes complication that affects the eyes. High sugar levels in the blood can lead towards the blocking of the tiny blood vessels in the retina. The retina is the light-sensitive layer of the eye on which the sight is projected and then transmitted to the brain. The damage to small vessels in the retina is called retinopathy. In the first stage, small widening and weak spots in the blood vessels occur, causing minor bleeding and fluid leakage.
Most people experience no discomfort at first, but urgent treatment is needed at this stage. Hence the necessary (annual) examination. The eye doctor is able to determine the injuries, even before you are experiencing discomfort. Later symptoms of diabetic retinopathy may include blurred or fluctuating vision, impaired color vision, spots or dark strings in your vision, and vision loss. Anyone who has diabetes can develop diabetic retinopathy.
If diabetes is not controlled in a proper way, the small capillaries can clog up in a next stage of the disease. This results in oxygen deficiency in various places in the retina. Subsequently, new capillaries are created that are of very poor quality. They burst easily and can cause pronounced bleeding. A patient can suddenly notice a dark spot, or can lose sight for months due to the thick blood curtain. If nothing is done at this stage, the newly formed blood vessels will shrivel up and eventually tear off the retina, resulting in definitive blindness. Thanks to a strict sugar and blood pressure check and annual preventive examinations at the eye doctor, the risk can be limited to the strict minimum.
Goal - Why we need your help!
The ""Eye for diabetes"" (""Oog voor diabetes"" in Dutch) project has the goal to create a computer model based on artificial intelligence to be able to detect early signs of diabetic retinopathy. This computer model can only be trained successfully by supplying it with a huge amount of example images on which the signs of diabetic retinopathy have been labeled by humans. Early signs of diabetic retinopathy can be subtle and difficult to spot, even for well-trained specialists. We need your help in our search to find specific signs of diabetic retinopathy in a public dataset from EyePacs (a screening network in the US).
Your help will allow us to make a significant difference to the detection and follow up of diabetic retinopathy, and will better support the eye health of all patients suffering from diabetes.
Approach
Thanks to the progress recently made in the domain of artificial intelligence, computers can detect diseases in medical images with the accuracy of a human specialist. Training artificial intelligence with this kind of quality requires a large amount of high quality examples. A few public datasets showing signs of diabetic retinopathy have already been created by ophthalmologists but they are way too small to obtain good results. We need at least 100 times the amount of labeled images. This kind of work can not be done by a few specialists, but it can be done by a large group of people!
The EyePACS screening network has made a large dataset of retinal images from diabetes patients publicly available. EyePACS has given us permission to use their dataset to label the lesions, caused by diabetes, on them. To the best of our knowledge, the EyePACS dataset is the largest, public available, DR screening dataset from a diverse number of screening centers. It has been used in numerous scientific publications, and is our data set of choice to create better labels for.
All labels of signs of diabetic retinopathy created in this project will be made publicly available. This will allow ALL patients with diabetes, no matter in which country, to benefit from our work.

140;Heritage Quest;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/evakap/heritage-quest/about/research;"Welcome to Heritage Quest!
Join us in our search for undiscovered archaeological remains
Our mission
The aim of this project is to find archaeological remains hidden under dense vegetation cover, especially prehistoric burial mounds and field systems. In recent years high-resolution elevation maps created with a technique called LiDAR have become widely available. The big advantage compared to many other measurement techniques is that LiDAR is not hampered by the presence of vegetation. This allows the investigation of areas in which archaeological remains are currently obscured by forest cover or other types of vegetation.
In this project we investigate the Utrechtse Heuvelrug, a heavily forested region in the Netherlands. Over the course of 2019, Heritage Quest has investigated the Veluwe with spectacular results (see section on results). The Veluwe and the Utrechtse Heuvelrug are similar in many respects. Archaeologically, both regions are famous for the large number of burial mounds. However, the dense forest cover undoubtedly hides many more.
By jointly inspecting the c. 400 km2 of the Utrechtse Heuvelrug we are certain that many unknown archaeological remains will be discovered. These new discoveries will inform us about the past societies that left them and they will be added to the national database of known archaeological features and as such protected for posterity.

LiDAR elevation map of the Utrechtse Heuvelrug (higher area on the left) and the Veluwe (right) and their position in the Netherlands (right map) (source: AHN)
What are LiDAR data?
LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) is a survey technique that measures the distance to a target by illuminating the target with pulsed laser light and a sensor that registers the reflected pulses. The result is a 3 dimensional point cloud.
The entire surface of the Netherlands has been measured by airborne LiDAR providing a detailed elevation model. This constantly updated model is made available for public use by Current Dutch Elevation (Actueel Hoogtebestand Nederland), a cooperation of provinces, national government and water boards.
For the first time, these LiDAR data allow for the investigation of areas which are obscured by forest cover.
You therefore could be the first person in 4000 years to find a burial mound.
Traces from the past: what do we expect
A large number of past human activities resulted in local changes in elevation. These are the type of archaeological remains that we can identify in LiDAR data. Based on our present knowledge we expect a range of features to frequently appear in the maps presented here.
The most common and probably best recognisable feature is the burial mound, also known as barrow. These are ancient burial places marked by an earthen mound. In the Netherlands this type of burial was used from c. 2800 BC until the Roman period (c. 200 AD).
Celtic fields are groups of ancient agricultural fields where the borders between the different fields consist of low earthen ridges. The individual fields are about 40 x 40 m and together they form a kind of checkerboard pattern on the elevation map. Celtic fields cover quite large areas of the Utrechtse heuvelrug.
The third category that will be systematically searched for in this project are cart tracks. These are the depressions worn out by cart wheels when drawn over unpaved sandy terrain. When tracks became too deep, a new route was taken parallel to the old one. In this way large band of cart tracks have sometimes developed.

Burial mounds, cart tracks and part of a Celtic field
Iron extraction pits, traces of roads and track ways as well as remains from the Second World War are also frequently encountered on the Utrechtse Heuvelrug. These types of remains will be tackled in a later stage of the Heritage Quest project.
There are also several other types of archaeological finds that will appear less frequently. These include for example traces of a motte castle or medieval boundaries. Even a Roman military camp might be an option as one has been found even further north of the Limes, the northern border of the Roman empire.
Machine learning and automated detection
In addition to discovering unknown examples of archaeological remains, this project aims to assist an innovative academic project that investigates the potential of machine learning and automated detection in archaeology. The task of the Heritage Quest project is to enlarge the number of archaeological remains that can act as examples from which the computer can learn how to independently identify archaeological features like burial mounds. At the same time the archaeological features newly discovered by volunteers will be used to verify the output of the computer.
How can Zooniverse volunteers help?
The Utrechtse Heuvelrug covers an area of about 400 km2. This is an enormous region to inspect and impossible for professional archaeologists to examine alone. Moreover, it has been widely attested in archaeological prospection that people's ability to identify specific features varies. People tend to have a bias for certain types of remains. It is therefore important that several different people inspect every dataset. By registering as a volunteer you can start the search. Through the talk section we will keep you informed about all activities and first results of the project.
So if you are interested in the past join our quest for archaeological heritage! Although be warned the search can be addictive!"

144;Davy Notebooks Project;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/humphrydavy/davy-notebooks-project/about/research;"Research
Aims
Sir Humphry Davy (1778-1829) was perhaps the most famous chemist of the nineteenth century. This project aims to transcribe five of Davy’s early notebooks, which show his experiments in both chemistry and poetry.
The notebooks selected for this pilot run reveal how Davy’s mind worked and how his thinking developed. Containing details of his scientific experiments, poetry, geological observations, travel accounts, and personal philosophy, Davy's notebooks present us with a wide range of fascinating insights. Many of the pages of these notebooks have never been transcribed before. By transcribing these notebooks, we will find out more about the young Davy, his life, and the cultures and networks of which he was part.
The transcriptions produced by Zooniverse participants, and images of the manuscript pages, will later be published online on a custom-built, open access website, providing unprecedented access to these important historical documents. All individual participants will be given the option to be listed in the Acknowledgements section of the Davy Notebooks Project website. This is entirely optional, and at the sole discretion of each individual participant.
We hope that transcribers will also take part in the next run of our FutureLearn Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) ‘Humphry Davy: Laughing Gas, Literature, and the Lamp’. You will be able to sign up to this course at the end of July and the four-week course will begin on 28 October 2019.

ADDITIONAL NOTEBOOKS
Message from the Davy Notebooks Team, 29 July 2019:
The project has been a resounding success so far. Thanks so much to all our volunteers for helping us to transcribe these notebooks at such a phenomenal rate. As the first five notebooks have been transcribed ahead of time, we're going to add three additional notebooks to this pilot project. We may not manage to present final transcriptions of these on our website by December 2019, but will do so as soon as possible thereafter. As we're experimenting, each page of the next three notebooks will be transcribed by five volunteers rather than three before being retired.
Details of the additional notebooks will be added here, and on the Talk boards, as they are released.
RI MS HD/14/I
Marbled notebook, red spine and corners (6½"" x 9""); containing poetry, notes for Davy's later-published works Salmonia (1828) and Consolations in Travel (1830), and sketches; 146 manuscript pages + leaves a-e at front; dating from 1813-26.
RI MS HD/14/E
Calfskin-covered notebook, with vertical flap and cord (6"" x 4""); contains draft poetry (some copied from other notebooks), miscellaneous notes, and a daily journal (27 June-13 July 1827); 188 manuscript pages; dating from 1827.
RI MS HD/20/C
Marbled hard-covered notebook, in quarto size; contains Davy's notes of the period on chemistry and galvanic action; 174 manuscript pages; dating from 1800.

145;Measuring Giraffes;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/derekedwardlee/measuring-giraffes/about/research;"The Wild Nature Institute conducts scientific research on endangered wildlife and inspires the public to protect wild nature.
Masai giraffes live only in Tanzania and Kenya, and their numbers are falling fast. Giraffes are vulnerable to extinction due to habitat loss and illegal hunting; their numbers have declined drastically to only 90,000. Masai giraffe numbers have declined over 50% in the last few decades!
Our work helps giraffes and people to coexist.
Our giraffe conservation research is discovering where Masai giraffes are doing well, where they are not, and why. Wild Nature Institute scientists are studying wild Masai giraffes in Tanzania using each animal’s unique fur pattern as identification.
We are monitoring thousands of individual giraffes throughout their lifetimes to document births, deaths, and movements. This is the world's biggest giraffe study and one of the biggest wildlife demography studies in history, covering 25,000 square kilometers in the Tarangire Ecosystem and Serengeti Ecosystem.
Our giraffe research is urgently needed so we can provide effective protection actions in an ever more fragmented world, and ensure the future of wild giraffes and all creatures of the savanna. In addition to our scientific conservation research, we use giraffe-themed environmental education and grassroots advocacy to protect and connect areas important to Masai giraffe conservation in Tanzania and around the world. We promote giraffe conservation through our Giraffe-themed conservation education and children's books, and we support anti-poaching activities to keep giraffes safe.

These kids are enjoying our giraffe education materials and activities.
We need your help to save giraffes. In addition to helping with this measuring project.
Donate Money or Time. Giving money and/or donating time to conservation groups like Wild Nature Institute is a great action to help giraffes. People can use their skills by providing advice, services, or goods in their personal area of expertise that can help the cause.
Raise Awareness about the Silent Extinction of Giraffes. Speak up within your social circles, and encourage others to donate money or time to saving giraffes. You can raise awareness in your home communities by writing, speaking, and contributing to the global conversation about our planet’s climate and biodiversity crises. Use the Hashtag #standtallforgiraffe
Plant Native Trees. Giraffes and many other species need native trees, but deforestation continues worldwide. Planting native trees helps fight the global climate crisis and helps biodiversity too!
Support Legal Protections for Wildlife. Laws like the Endangered Species Act and other environmental laws make the world safer for wildlife and people. Call and write to your congressperson, senator, governor, and president telling them you support strong law enforcement to protect wildlife.
We can craft a personal plan for you to become a giraffe hero. Email us at info@wildnatureinstitute.org.

146;Snapshot Elephants for Africa;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/shuebner729/snapshot-elephants-for-africa/about/research;"Elephants for Africa (EFA) is a UK charity and Botswana registered NGO, conducting research primarily on male African savannah elephant (Loxodonta africana, hereafter referred to as elephant) social behavior and group dynamics. In the past the vast majority of research into elephant sociality has focused on female society and group behavior, whilst males were written off as being solitary and antisocial. Nowadays there is a growing realization that male elephants are also social and spend time living in groups, however these social groups are very different from female breeding herds, and are a lot less well understood.

EFA collect long-term data on interactions and associations between individual bull elephants, which are identified using ear notch patterns and tusk morphology. We conduct our research in the Makgadikgadi Pans National Park (MPNP), in Botswana. The MPNP elephant population is of interest to us as it consists of predominantly bull elephants – over 95% of the elephants that we record are transient males. Therefore it is an ideal place to study the social behavior of the all-male groups found in this “bull area”. We are interested in understanding more about the social behavior of these males because we believe that the dynamic, fission-fusion nature of their interactions may influence behavior later in life, especially in terms of dominance hierarchies and behaviors such as crop raiding. Understanding male elephant social behavior, how it might differ in areas dominated by bulls from breeding herd areas, and what impact social interactions have on learning, dominance hierarchies and information transfer is also fundamental to being able to predict responses to changing ecological conditions and human encroachment.
To supplement our focal sighting data, EFA set up a network of camera traps which were running from 2014, until April 2017. These camera traps were located on elephant highways, well-worn pathways created by elephants, leading to the Boteti River in the MPNP. By monitoring elephant movement along these highways, we can investigate the demographics and group sizes of elephants using the highways, as well as their movement patterns in relation to factors such as time of day, season, river level, cropping season and moon phase. In addition, camera traps allow us an opportunity to investigate how group size and demographics may differ between day and night, as our driven research transects only take place during the day. From personal observation, it would also seem that the few female elephant breeding herds that are in the MPNP often drink from the river at night, and so may be under-represented in our transect data collection. Therefore camera traps are also an ideal tool to allow us to monitor the presence of breeding herds in the area.
Elephants are known as a “keystone species”; they can modify and maintain their habitat, often to the benefit of other species in the ecosystem. One way in which they can do this is by creating pathways in the environment, such as the elephant highways leading to the river. Our camera trap study also aims to investigate the spatial and temporal use of elephant highways, not only by elephants but also by other species. Our camera trap data forms a large part of our MPNP species monitoring and provides data on species composition within the park that are generally less easily obtainable from research drives and personal observation. Camera traps provide an effective method for collecting long-term data on the population demographics of species within the MPNP. Seasonal and annual changes in species populations, based on the frequency of their capture on our camera traps, can provide useful information about ecological changes in the park. Camera traps also have the added advantage of recording data continually, therefore can record the frequency of nocturnal species sightings and of the more elusive species that are rarely recorded during our transect drives. No other species monitoring of this nature is currently taking place in the MPNP, and so this important information will be fed back to the Department of Wildlife and National Parks, who manage the Park.
Various habitat types are found in the MPNP (Figure 1). A belt of tall, dense riparian Acacia woodland with a lower canopy of densely vegetated shrubland extends 2-5km from the riverbed. Moving further east, away from the river, the vegetation becomes more open Acacia savannah-type shrubland, and shrubbed grasslands. Further east still, the deep Kalahari sands give way to calcareous sandy loams, which support Schmidtia grasslands, with isolated stands of palm trees (Hyphaena petersiana). Finally, in the south east of the MPNP are the salt pans which give the Park its name, that form a mosaic with pan grasslands (Brooks, 2005).

147;SquirrelMapper;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/bcosentino/squirrelmapper/about/research;"The question ...
So-called ""gray squirrels"" and ""black squirrels"" are two color morphs of the same species: Sciurus carolinensis. Until 150 years ago, the black morph was much more abundant. Yet now the black morph is rare, except in cities. Why has the black morph declined? Why does it linger in cities? Will it return again to the countryside? The landscape is changing rapidly. Will the gray squirrel, and other mammals like it, be able to adapt quickly enough?
Genetics
Only a tiny genetic difference separates black versus gray morphs. All individuals contain a gene, MC1R, that controls how much dark pigment is added as a squirrel's hairs grow. When a tiny piece of DNA is missing from this gene, it boosts production of dark pigment and makes the fur darker. When a squirrel has a single copy of the gene with the small piece of DNA deleted, or two copies of that altered gene, its fur is mostly black. Technically, the black morph is melanic. The gray morph has two copies of the complete gene. A tiny genetic difference, but being black or gray could have many consequences if you are a squirrel!
Contemporary evolution
Squirrels that don't blend in well with their backgrounds don;t survive as well. What kills squirrels? Predators...mainly hawks, foxes, and dogs. Humans also kill many squirrels: squirrel hunting is ""big"" in rural areas. But you can't hunt in cities, so maybe that's why black morphs more frequent in urban areas.

There could be other forces at work. Our forests have changed. Originally forests of eastern North America were mostly old growth with pockets of darkness associated with enormous tree trunks, many vertical layers that generated shade, and more conifer trees with dark foliage. In these darker conditions perhaps the black morph could remain better hidden. Now virtually all old growth forests have disappeared.
The forests that have re-grown are secondary forest with spindly trunks of mostly deciduous trees whose trunks and branches are much lighter-hued. In such forests might the gray morph be better hidden than the black morph from predators and hunters?
It gets even more interesting...urban areas have expanded. Urban areas may not just be refuges from hunting. In urban areas most squirrels are killed by cars. Most drivers try to avoid hitting animals even if they don't always succeed. The sooner a driver sees a squirrel, the easier it is to avoid running it over. The gray morph has a remarkable similarity in hue to pavement, so may be harder for drivers to see. Does the black morph stand out better against a road surface and be more avoidable by car drivers, that is, survive better?

How can you use SquirrelMapper to answer these questions?
By mapping where black and gray morphs occur in our cities, towns, farms and forests you can contribute to an important scientific discovery about evolution in action in our own backyards. The SquirrelMapper project has two components:
Contribute observations of squirrels to the SquirrelMapper project on iNaturalist. Over 30,000 photographs of squirrels have been submitted so far. When you submit an observation, the community of citizen scientists at iNaturalist confirm its identification. Once an observation is confirmed to be an eastern gray squirrel (a research grade observation), we import the photo to Zooniverse for you to classify by its coat color.
Classify the coat color of squirrels as gray or black here at Zooniverse. The coat color of each squirrel is confirmed through classifications by many Zooinverse volunteers like you. Once you classify it, we map it, identify its habitat, and determine which morph occurs more often where. This lets us understand how quickly squirrels, and mammals like them, can adapt to changes in their habitats. See Results for some preliminary outcomes. Click the classify link to get started!
Here's the project workflow:
Important note
We rely on photos of squirrels taken by citizen scientists at iNaturalist. Some of these photos are of dead squirrels. Volunteers classifying the color of squirrels in this project will occasionally encounter photos of dead squirrels.
Try our Find the Squirrel game too!
In addition to mapping squirrel color morphs, try our Find the Squirrel game to help us measure natural selection on coat color. In this game you will search for squirrels in scenes of old growth forests, secondary forests, and roads, and we measure how long it takes you to find gray and black squirrels in each scene. By participating in the game you will directly measure the selection pressures on black and gray squirrels in each environment.

Welcome to the Deep Lake Explorer, where you can explore the underwater world of the Great Lakes and help us understand invasive species impact on ecosystems. You can see for yourself how invaders like zebra mussels, quagga mussels, round gobies, and even litter can transform ecosystems. If you are lucky, you can also catch glimpses of native fishes and even tiny insects living along the bottom of the lake.

Deep Lake Explorer analyzes video collected through the EPA’s National Coastal Condition Assessment, and EPA's Cooperative Science and Monitoring Initiative. The videos can provide a wealth of information, but we need your help interpreting them! This project is one of the first Zooniverse efforts to analyze underwater video, and will pave the way for more effective, timely analysis of underwater video in the future.
Why care about the Great Lakes?
The Laurentian Great Lakes form the largest surface freshwater system on Earth by area. These lakes support more than 30 million people living within their watersheds. The Great Lakes are a dominant part of the physical, ecological, and cultural heritage of the region.

Great Lakes satellite imagery from NASA's Worldview.
Today, they provide a clean source of drinking water for residents, and host a shipping industry that moves approximately 164 million metric tons of cargo every year. Residents and tourists enjoy swimming, boating, beach combing, fishing, and many other forms of recreating on the lakes and their shorelines. The Great Lakes ecosystem has 180 species of native fish and supports a major commercial and recreational fishing industry.
Despite their significant size, the Great Lakes are vulnerable to the effects of many pollutants and stressors. This study will help us understand the changing Great Lakes ecosystem and help resource professionals make informed decisions about how to restore, regulate, manage, and protect the Great Lakes.
Great Lakes Invaders
In the past several decades, over 180 non-native species have been introduced into the Great Lakes. A few of these aquatic invaders have significantly altered Great Lakes ecosystems. Aquatic invasive species are as challenging to study as they are to control. Studies have fallen short of describing the spread and abundance of invasive species throughout the entire Great Lakes through time.

Left: Invasive mussels attached to rocks, Right: Round goby with visible black dorsal spot.
Underwater video footage can provide information about the presence and abundance of invasive species within different habitats. The example below shows both round gobys and invasive mussels. Through Deep Lake Explorer, you can identify invasive species like round gobies and zebra and quagga mussels and classify habitat, which will help us better understand and predict the presence of these species in the Great Lakes.
Your browser does not support playing HTML5 video. You can download a copy of the video file instead. This example video shows both round gobies swimming along the bottom and invasive mussels attached to boulders. Round gobies have a characteristic black spot on their dorsal fin that is visible in this video.
How it Works
On Deep Lake Explorer, multiple people review each video clip. If you make a mistake, don't worry about it, because many others will also review it. Just choose your best guess.
After a brief tutorial, you will start classifying underwater video clips. For each clip, we ask you to answer several simple questions about what you see. There are many resources to help you answer questions, including the Tutorial, Field Guide, FAQ, and the Talk forum where you can ask scientists questions about clips or the project. It is that simple!
Get Started now!
Where were the videos collected?
The videos you analyze on Deep Lake Explorer were collected on the Niagara River and Lake Ontario in 2018, and on Lake Huron in 2017.

150;Hubble Asteroid Hunter;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/sandorkruk/hubble-asteroid-hunter/about/research;"Welcome to our project! The idea of the Hubble Asteroid Hunters is to identify asteroid trails in archival images from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, which are stored in the European Space Agency (ESA)'s Hubble Science archive and accessible at ESA's ESASky Portal.
Sometimes when we are observing stars in the Milky Way or far away galaxies asteroids orbiting the Sun a few tens or hundreds of millions of kilometres away happen to pass through the observed field and appear in the foreground of telescope images. For example, the image below is part of a survey made with the Hubble Space Telescope called the Hubble Frontier Fields and and it shows thousands of distant galaxies, as well as a few stars from our own Milky Way. Most of the galaxies appear tiny and blue, but the image also contains some impressive spiral galaxies and huge red elliptical galaxies.
The image also shows trails of asteroids that were passing by at the time of the observation. These appear curved due to an effect called parallax. As the Hubble Space Telescope orbits around Earth and images a patch of the sky for a certain amount of time, asteroids will appear to move along an arc with respect to the more distant background stars and galaxies. Because of this parallax effect, asteroids that were closer to us at the time appear passing more rapidly, and thus leaving longer trails in the images, compared to more distant objects.
This image is a mosaic of many exposures, which is why some asteroids appear multiple times. In this mosaic, 20 asteroid trails are visible, belonging to 7 unique objects; five of these were new discoveries. The positions of the asteroid trail in the images allow us to derive what astronomers call the asteroid's ""ephemeris"" (its position and velocity over time), since we know the time when the image was taken. By observing the same asteroid in multiple exposures, we can refine its ephemeris and therefore can predict better their future orbit.

[Credits: NASA, ESA, and B. Sunnquist and J. Mack (STScI) (CC BY-SA 4.0)]
In this project, we use archival images made by the Hubble Space Telescope to find asteroids observed by chance. The ESASky team compared the observation epoch and field of view of these images with the computed orbits of asteroids, to identify possible observations. The positions predicted by the algorithm, nevertheless, have some associated uncertainty because the ephemerides are not always known to great precision. This uncertainty increases with the amount of time between the last observation date and the date we predict the position for. Identifying the asteroids in the images (if present) and marking the exact position of their trail allows us to update the ephemerides and help us better characterise these objects.
Instead of a coloured mosaic (as shown in the previous picture) we use single exposures.
These observations will be used by the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center to compute the orbits and update the ephemerides of asteroids to better predict their future trajectories.
Identifying asteroids in archival observations is essential to measure their trajectories with higher accuracy and to follow them up in order to further characterise their sizes, shapes and masses, so that we can better understand the asteroid population and potential threats to Earth can be identified. The identification of asteroids will also be used to train a neural network to recognise such objects in images, by scanning the whole HST archive for images of asteroids, including both objects whose orbits are known and those previously unknown to us that were serendipitously observed by Hubble Space Telescope.

151;Euclid - Challenge the Machines;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/hughdickinson/euclid-challenge-the-machines/about/research;"Finding Strong Gravitational Lenses
Motivation
Gravitational lenses are useful for putting constraints on values of the Hubble constant, the dark energy equation of state, dark matter halo substructure, and for studying high-redshift galaxies at high spatial and flux magnification. Rare lens systems, for example the Jackpot lens, are particularly useful for dark energy and halo profiles. There is a need to find rare lens configurations to obtain statistics on lens and source parameters and to improve cosmological parameters. However rare lens systems can only be found with large lens samples, and large survey samples are also needed to remove small number statistics. The Euclid telescope, due for launch in 2021, will perform an imaging and slitless spectroscopy survey over half the sky, to map baryon wiggles and weak lensing. During the survey Euclid is expected to resolve 100,000 strong gravitational lens systems. This is ideal to find rare lens configurations, provided they can be identified reliably and on a reasonable timescale.
An example of a lensed galaxy, blue arcs around a central object.
Problem
The question of how to find strong gravitational lenses in large datasets is a daunting data mining problem within Euclid. Feature recognition by eye, which is currently the best method for identifying strong gravitational lenses, will not be fast enough to cope with the amount of data received. The Strong Lensing group within the Euclid consortium set up the Euclid Strong Lensing challenge. This was a challenge aimed at building machine learning techniques to classify Euclid-like simulations as containing a lens or not. Amazingly, these artificial intelligences outperformed a human expert who trawled through the entire dataset. However we know from other Zooniverse projects, like Spacewarps, that volunteers are excellent at finding gravitational lenses. Can these artificial intelligence machine learning programs out perform all humans?
Is there a lens in either of the images?
Goal
The goal of this project is to test if humans are still better at identifying gravitational lenses than the machine learning algorithms. Machines have been tested on this same data set, meaning a fair comparison can be made between the two techniques. Once the images have been classified, the data will be analysed to find out if the humans are still better, or have machine learning techniques improved enough to beat the humans. The images to be classified are simulated, designed to simulate images from the Kilo Degree Survey. The size of each image is 10 arc-second by 10 arc-second. The redshift of centre galaxy in each image is 1.5, meaning the actual distance in the image is approximately 84 kiloparsecs. We are using simulated Kilo Degree Survey images as simulations of the expected Euclid images are not yet ready and we expect to get similar results using the Euclid simulations.
App version
As well as the browser version of this project, this project is available to complete using the app version of Zooniverse. The app version allows you to swipe yes or swipe no for each image, speeding up classifying the galaxies (and it is more fun). The Zooniverse app is available for both Android and iOS and can be downloaded for free from the Google Play Store and the App store for Android and iOS respectively."
152;Snapshot De Hoop;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/shuebner729/snapshot-de-hoop/about/research;"The aim of the Snapshot Safari – South Africa project is to provide extensive mammal occupancy and distribution data from conservation priority areas in South Africa as well as to develop and test survey methodology and conservation effectiveness assessments. This study will investigate how the structure and abundance of mammal communities, influenced by natural as well as anthropogenic processes, affects mammal species diversity and assemblages.
In response to the urgent need for more accurate assessment of mammal occupancy and populations we are launching a new research project called Snapshot Safari – South Africa as a continuation of Snapshot Safari – Serengeti, where citizen scientists worldwide helped to classify millions of photographs collected by a network of camera traps in Tanzania’s Serengeti National Park.
Snapshot Safari – South Africa will include an unprecedented network of camera trap grids in dozens of protected areas and protected area expansion areas in South Africa to provide continuous monitoring of population sizes and trends of all the larger (>10 kg) mammal species at each site. Some of the participating study areas are managed as conservancies and stewardship areas, some are privately owned, some are state-run, and others are under communal tenure. With the help of accurate camera trap censuses, and innovative mapping approaches we will be able to identify which sites are being managed successfully - and hence which conservation strategies should be incorporated into a toolbox for effective wildlife management.
Snapshot Safari – South Africa will enable us to closely examine questions of species occupancy, species coexistence, competition, trophic interactions, the effect of change, and other ecological relationships across a variety of habitat types, community compositions, and management strategies. It will further provide a solid baseline for future monitoring of change as well as anthropogenic impacts. The results will contribute to the development and refinement of important methods to conserve species and ecosystems.
In addition to methods for calculating population size, camera traps also allow for a greater understanding of key demographic parameters. For example, using images of young animals, we gain information about breeding seasonality and duration, % females with young, and mortality of young. All of these are key parameters critical for both conservation management and conservation planning. Furthermore, the camera trap data are an important resource for understanding distribution and temporal occupancy for different mammal communities. Our data will document occupancy across seasons and years, allowing us to gain an understanding of seasonal occupancy.
The full data set that will be developed will be an important resource for future researchers and managers to study or gain information on environmental change, species dynamics, biodiversity patterns, species conservation status, conservation management, biodiversity planning and protected area monitoring."

In addition to methods for calculating population size, camera traps also allow for a greater understanding of key demographic parameters. For example, using images of young animals, we gain information about breeding seasonality and duration, % females with young, and mortality of young. All of these are key parameters critical for both conservation management and conservation planning. Furthermore, the camera trap data are an important resource for understanding distribution and temporal occupancy for different mammal communities. Our data will document occupancy across seasons and years, allowing us to gain an understanding of seasonal occupancy.
The full data set that will be developed will be an important resource for future researchers and managers to study or gain information on environmental change, species dynamics, biodiversity patterns, species conservation status, conservation management, biodiversity planning and protected area monitoring."

Large mammals found across Lopé National Park play a crucial role in shaping this beautiful forest-savannah transitional landscape. However, their population is threatened, and as you can imagine, it is more intense around the edges of the forest.
To ensure effective conservation of both wild animals and the landscape, we need to further understand the population structure of large mammals and their interactions with the landscape especially around the forest edge.
We are using camera trap data from the forests of Lopé National Park that were collected by Anabelle Cardoso who hosted the Elephant Expedition project on Zooniverse some years ago as part of her Ph.D. We have over a million photos from the field, but we have tried to sort out empty images. So, be confident you will see some animals in most photos as you go along.
What we need you to do help do is to identify the animal(s) in each of the photos, indicate the number of individuals you see and tell us what you find the animal(s) doing. We have provided more information to guide you as you go along.
We decided to classify these photos on Zooniverse because we are interested in fostering public participation in biodiversity conservation research which is one of the objectives of this study. We hope that this increases awareness to the status of and threats to wildlife in Lopé and inspire conservation action. Thus, we have asked all our volunteers to indicate once, if they have any professional affiliation with biodiversity conservation. We also encourage you to share your experience on Wild Gabon with us. Please email charles.emogor@linacre.ox.ac.uk to get in touch!

In the United States greater than 80% of the human population occurs in cities, yet we know very little about the wildlife in these areas. Much work needs to be done to understand how increases in urbanized areas impact wildlife species and their ability to survive around us. Urbanization poses many threats to wildlife such as loss of habitat, fragmentation of habitat, roads and traffic, poisons and toxins, people, and our pets. This project is striving to collect information that can be used by city planners to help them make educated decisions about wildlife when planning future developments.
To better understand what wildlife species are present and identify spatial and long-term patterns of wildlife in Los Angeles we have began a camera project where we monitor sites throughout a variety of urban densities. Cameras are placed in urban and rural parks, golf courses, and undeveloped strips of land where permission could be obtained to mount cameras. One of the main projects that will be posting photos on to this platform is currently monitoring 37 camera sites in areas within 2 km of the Los Angeles River. At each site a motion-triggered camera is deployed for one month four times per year once during each season. Cameras are monitored by partner groups (see team to identify groups involved) or volunteers that are participating in the project.
The City of Los Angeles is working to preserve biodiversity and are in need of wildlife occurrence information to assist with their city planning. Data from this project will help fill in some areas where there is little known information about local wildlife and help the city make educated decision in future planning.
National Park Service also monitors numerous other cameras to look at roadways and identify ways to improve permeability as well as cameras to monitor post fire areas. These data sets may also be put up on Zooniverse in their own work flow when the data is completed for the LA city camera project so please continue to check back even if all of the data has been completed for the LA River camera project.
Why we need your help
Zooniverse users are invaluable to the project and ultimately turn the photos into data that can be analyzed by tagging species and number of individuals. This data can be combined with info collected in the field and through remote sensing to identify factors that affect wildlife in the region. We also plan to use this data to visualize animal population changes through time and combined with other data enable us to see if populations increase or decrease with changes on the landscape.
We are hoping that you will assist us with this project and see what is living among the millions of people living in the Los Angeles area: such as lions, bears, coyotes, gray foxes, opossums, roadrunners and many other species. Share your favorites and join the discussion about what you are observing along the way. As the project progresses, we will share with you what we are learning on this project and other work our scientists at the park are learning in Talk and through the Santa Monica Mountains NRA and SAMO Funds social media accounts. So please stay tuned and help us move this project forward.

157;ForestEyes;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/dallaqua/foresteyes/about/research;"ForestEyes - using citizens to track deforestation
Conservation of tropical forests is a relevant issue because of their important role in the global ecosystem. They have a great diversity of fauna and flora, besides regulating the climate and rainfall, absorbing large quantities of carbon dioxide and being indigenous dwellings. Unfortunately, millions of hectares have been lost and degraded over the years.
The rainforests need to be protected and collective action to complement existing initiatives of conservation need to be created.
The ForestWatchers Project was created in 2012 with this purpose: to ally Citizen Science with forest monitoring. In one of its applications, remote sensing images of forested areas were classified into forest or non-forest with an automated classification algorithm and the accuracy of the resulting map could be further improved by volunteer observation on the Web.
Inspired by this application of ForestWatchers, this Citizen Science project wants citizens to help us to track deforestation. Volunteers will be classifying latest remote sensing tiles that are going to be the training set of a classification algorithm. This procedure is expected to be fast and cheap, helping to track deforestation even in places where does not exist any official monitoring programs on tropical forests.
To determine which remote sensing tiles are going to be analyzed by the volunteers, techniques of a machine learning paradigm known as Active Learning will be used. It has the goal to incrementally build a training set with a small number of samples but with high representativeness, achieving maximum accuracy in the classification of new samples. For this application, the procedure will be: we start with a very small training set to automatic classify remote sensing images' pixels in forest or non-forest; the active learning technique will choose new potential samples to be included in the training set; these samples will be analyzed and classified by volunteers in this citizen science project; the samples classified here will be added to the training set and the automatic classifier will be trained and the active learning technique will choose new samples to be analyzed and classified by the volunteers and so on. This procedure will be carried out until the automatic classifier reachs a reasonable hit rate.
The images currently used in this project are images obtained by NASA's MODIS sensor (https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/) and by Landsat-8/OLI satellite (https://landsat.usgs.gov/landsat-8). The MODIS images were kindly provided by the ForestWatchers Project team and the images from Landsat-8/OLI are available for free by USGS (United States Geological Survey) at https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/. In the future images from other satellites may be used.
For preliminary studies and validation of this project were carried out tasks with the same data used in ForestWatchers Project: images from MODIS sensor for the areas of Rondônia state (Brazil) in the year 2011 and the indigenous reservation of Awá-Guajá (Maranhão state - Brazil) in the year 2014. Currently tasks are being carried out with Landsat-8/OLI images of Rondônia state in the year 2016. The obtained results for these and for future tasks will always be available in Results.
The current application is LANDSAT 8 - Segments. With a method called Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) a remote sensing image from an area of Rondônia State (Brazil) was segmented in approximately 1000 pieces. We need the volunteers to classify each segment in Forest, Non-Forest or Undefined. Each segment can be seen in a RGB composition image or a false-color composition with bands 7, 5 and 3 of LANDSAT-8.
The classified segments will be used to train an automatic classifier that will analyze new remote sensing imagery to track rainforests' deforestation."

This study will investigate how the structure and abundance of mammal communities, influenced by natural as well as anthropogenic processes, affects mammal species diversity and assemblages.
Snapshot Safari – South Africa represents an unprecedented network of camera trap grids in dozens of protected areas and protected area expansion areas in South Africa to provide continuous monitoring of population sizes and trends of all the larger (>10 kg) mammal species at each site. Some of the participating study areas are managed as conservancies and stewardship areas, some are privately owned, some are state-run, and others are under communal tenure. With the help of accurate camera trap censuses, and innovative mapping approaches we will identify which sites are being managed successfully - and hence which conservation strategies should be incorporated into a toolbox for effective wildlife management.
Snapshot Safari – South Africa will enable us to closely examine questions of species occupancy, species coexistence, competition, trophic interactions, the effect of change, and other ecological relationships across a variety of habitat types, community compositions, and management strategies.

159;Snapshot Enonkishu;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/aguthmann/snapshot-enonkishu/about/research;"Snapshot Enonkishu: Background and Model
Conservancy Background
Enonkishu Conservancy was first created in 2009 by Tarquin and Lippa Wood who had been running a maize and bean farm on the property. Originally, representatives from 282 families were willing to become members. It took 2.5 years to secure funding to pay for land rent resulting in 250 families owning 18,000 acres backing out and renting their land to large scale farmers. The conservancy currently has 32 members and encompasses 4224 acres of land. A mark of Enonkishu’s success will be the expansion of the conservancy northwards, re-claiming land that has been lost to agriculture and expanding the Mara-Serengeti Ecosystem.
More information can be found at: www.enonkishu.org or for current events, follow https://www.facebook.com/Enonkishu/
The Maasai Mara-Serengeti Ecosystem
Enonkishu is in a unique position, placed on the northern boundary of the Mara-Serengeti ecosystem of Kenya and Tanzania.
In addition, Enonkishu means “Cattle” in the Maa language. The preface of promoting the coexistence between wildlife and livestock is essential to building models of multiple revenue streams which will build stability in the Mara conservancies. Most conservancies in the Mara have cattle, many of which are grazed in a haphazard manner, and few of which are managed to maximize revenue generated by livestock. Enonkishu and Mara Training Centre therefore target conservancies in the Mara to campaign for regenerative grazing and diversifying conservancy incomes.
Land Rent from the Maasai community
Many Kenyan conservancies exist by leasing land by Maasai families. Land rental rates are high for Enonkishu because of the vulnerability of landowners converting their land to arable farming. Rental rates up until 2017 were determined by the amount of livestock owned by each landowner. In 2018 no funding was available; landowners agreed to being paid 3 x per year, coinciding with the due dates of school fees. In 2018, landowners were all paid at the same rate, with deductions to payments made for each cow being managed by ESCo.
Sustainable Rangeland Management by Mara Training Centre
MTC manages the grazing plan within Enonkishu by strategically deciding how many days the cows will spend grazing in each block according to wet/dry season. Enonkishu is divided into 9 blocks demarcated with natural landmarks. Transects within each block are monitored at the end of each quarter to track progress within ecological processes: mineral cycle, water cycle, community dynamics and energy flow. Herders are trained on the benefits of large herds bunched together, churning up the soil and fertilizing for future grass growth. Weekly briefings are conducted to keep the herders motivated and get feedback on the state of the grassland
CowCare
Prior to ESCo, landowners managed their own livestock husbandry and herders. Land rent rates were determined by the number of livestock each landowner kept at the conservancy. Herders employed by landowners often strayed from the grazing plan and not all livestock were cared for to the same degree, sparking the spread of disease. In 2018, all landowners were paid the same rate for their land, but livestock owners were deducted a fee per cow per month for livestock management. CowCare began in January 2018 with herders hired and trained by ESCo and MTC
Herds for Growth
(https://makinglifepeachy.com/peach-foundation-causes/herds-for-change/)
H4G was formed in September 2017 with a large donation from Peach Pubs (UK) for Enonkishu to purchase and manage a breeding herd that would belong to ESCo and benefit all landowners rather than solely the livestock owners. By 2020, the revenue from the Herds for Growth should make a serious contribution to land rent payments. Currently 178 heifers, 80 of which have been bred by a Boran bull, with introduced genes of quality beef. Herds for Growth serves as an example of management practices improving cattle investment and demonstrates a viable business model.
Last Line of Defence Trust (LLDT)
(https://www.facebook.com/LastLineofDefence/)
A trust was developed to support the communities and conservancies on the edge of the Mara, extending beyond Enonkishu. Projects supported by LLDT include an annual vaccination campaign, supporting trainings for communities curious about the coexistence of people, livestock, and seeks to participate in specific projects developed to bring communities together.
Research Objectives of Camera trap data
As Enonkishu was only protected in 2009, establishing an inventory of wildlife species seen within the conservancy is a primary objective of the placement of camera traps. Aside from a general inventory, as the SnapshotSafari program grows, it will be very interesting to compare species diversity in Enonkishu as compared to elsewhere, deeper into the Mara Serengeti Ecosystem. It will also be useful to investigate how species diversity is affected by distance from the boundary of the protected areas.

160;Snapshot Debshan;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/meredithspalmer/snapshot-debshan/about/research;"Debshan Ranch
Debshan Ranch is a large cattle ranch, with a rich and diverse abundance of wildlife. Probably the most unique feature of Shangani Ranch has been its philosophy of treating the wildlife found on the ranch as integral to the value of the ranching operation and not as competition to the cattle. The ranch constantly moves toward a more holistic approach to how the cattle and game are managed with management effects being constantly measured and adapted as necessary.
Since 2012, about 6,000 of the cattle on the ranch have been run without the use of fences to control and or restrict their movements. These 6,000 head are now divided into eleven herds which are herded during the day and kraaled at night with the people responsible for the herd living with them continually. The removal of internal paddock fences not only has given the ranch greater control over its cattle, but has been of significant benefit to the wildlife as well. Since 2012 the ranch has been moving toward the use of more indigenous cattle breeds in particular the ‘painted’ Ndebele Nkonie cattle.
Conservation
Plains game had always been present on both properties but by 1970 important species had disappeared, leaving only remnant herds of kudu, impala, tsessebe and reedbuck. After 1970, the game was actively protected and subsequently, eland, sable, waterbuck, bushbuck and zebra have been reintroduced. Proper management of the wildlife on the ranch has seen numbers grow steadily.
The turbulent political times of the 2000’s in Zimbabwe has seen the unfortunate loss of a lot of land which supported not only agricultural enterprises such as cattle ranching but wildlife as well. The loss of habitat for wildlife has meant that Debshan is probably, outside of the wildlife conservancy’s in the country, one of the largest landholdings which still have significant wildlife both in species diversity as well as numbers.
Since the 1990’s the ranch has seen elephants migrating from their usual home ranges in the north west of the country to the ranch. These migrations occur during the winter months and usually result in the ranch, by August, September, having anywhere up to 300 elephants on the ranch. A unique feature about this elephant population is that it is entirely made up of males with a large range in ages. Poaching of this population has been a problem since 2010. The ranch has responded to this poaching by improving both the training and the equipment of its anti-poaching force. This improvement has seen elephant poaching drop off significantly.
Holistic Management
Debshan Ranch transformed its way of managing in 2012 when it adopted the holistic approach. Since then, the grazing planning process which is a major component of the concept, has gone through a number of changes in an effort to sustain the cattle, wildlife and people. Planning grazing for animals is a process which involves all the players on the ranch as it has a lot of variables.
Exploring the complex interrelationship of all the variables and how the implementing team has adapted this to create ecological, economic and social balance has created a process which works. As Debshan Ranch continues to holistically manage their cattle and wildlife operation, some changes have been observed. Monitoring and analysing landscape function processes over 12 months has shown improvements which positively affect diversity. The social impact is also surveyed. An attempt to compute the qualitative benefits and changes economically is done. This necessitates defining the aspects of the triple bottom line to clarify the effects resulting from applying holistic principles.
The complexly simple interplay between the ecological, social and economic benefits is determined to be able to understand how the balance is gained and constantly adjusted transforming Debshan Ranch cattle and wildlife ranch into a ranch run per holistic principles has affected the operations and resource base. Debshan Ranch also influences the surrounding catchment and this development will ultimately impact the livestock industry in Zimbabwe. Social and political factors in Zimbabwe are ever changing and beyond the control of management.
Constant innovation in managing and strengthening the resource base will determine the survival and success of the entity. According to Alan Savory, ‘The process of decision making and planning that gives people the insights and management tools needed to understand nature: resulting in better, more informed decisions that balance key social, environmental and financial considerations’ is called holistic management. How applying this process will impact Shangani Ranch and ultimately, Zimbabwe’s livestock industry will be assessed.
Wildlife Research
Since 2012 the ranch has embarked on an exciting research program, conducting several research projects such as measuring the effects of the new holistic grazing system, elephant migration to and from the ranch, a study to determine the size and behavior of our leopard population down to works on butterflies, spiders and frogs. The research on the ranch is supported by a fully equipped research facility. It is hoped over time that this research will help the ranch to manage even more effectively not only the wildlife but the cattle as well.

Edmund Saul Dixon in Charles Dickens’ Household Words magazine, 1857
In the mid-nineteenth century, microscopy became immensely popular. Since microscopes were used in science, technology and medicine, practitioners in all three domains shared an interest in the instrument. And although the nineteenth century saw a specialisation and professionalisation of science, technology and medicine, microscopy continued to connect amateurs and professionals in various fields. This was facilitated by a wealth of newly available journals and handbooks on microscopy, which were widely distributed and circulated across Europe and America.
Microscopy publications invited microscopists to contribute and exchange material. They made it possible for microscopists in Europe and America to work together and spurred the formation of a strikingly diverse microscopy community. Illustrations of microscopic “worlds of wonder” were abundant in microscopy publications and made them particularly appealing. Often, illustrations and texts would be copied and reprinted, thus targeting several readerships at different places at the same time.
The purpose of Worlds of Wonder
Research into the nineteenth-century microscopy community will help us to better understand how practitioners with different disciplinary and educational backgrounds can collaborate in science, technology and medicine, even across national borders. Who could contribute their research to the community and how? Where did their contributions travel and how did they change along the way? We also hope to learn more about processes of discipline formation, as some nineteenth-century microscopists considered their field a scientific discipline in its own right.
To answer these questions, we ask for your help. Publications can be searched for terms, but it is a lot more difficult to identify and classify illustrations. Yet illustrations were crucial in determining research objectives and demarcating the domain of ""microscopical science"". We therefore ask you to analyse microscopy illustrations in nineteenth-century publications and identify their contributors. By doing so, you will make it easier for historians of science, technology, medicine and print to search and analyse a wealth of illustrations which crossed disciplinary and national boundaries. We are particularly interested in reproductions of illustrations, so please let us know on Talk if you see an illustration more than once!
Worlds of Wonder is conducted by researchers of the Science, Technology and Society Studies research group at Maastricht University (MUSTS). The digitised microscopy publications used in this project are hosted by the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL). Worlds of Wonder was inspired by Science Gossip of the ConSciCom research group, another Zooniverse project asking volunteers to classify illustrations, and we are indebted to their work."

Data in the student papers of the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS) collectively cover more than 100 years of research on ecology, environmental change, and plant and animal species. These data provide valuable information to researchers and students continuing to study these areas. Your task is to unearth the data so that it can be reused in current and future projects.
Currently
Researchers have to sift through pages and read reports to find data. In this Zooniverse project, you will identify which pages of the student papers actually have data, such as tables, photographs, maps, and observations. Once we have isolated the data with your help, we will be able to transcribe pages into a database. Then, the public, researchers, students, and policy makers will be able to look at and reuse data relevant to their research projects.
Examples of Possible Reuse
Possibly toxic algal species previously unseen in sites around northern Michigan have been observed in recent years, according to UMBS faculty. The blue-green alga Planktothrix that could have toxic strains was newly observed in a nearby lake by faculty who have taught and studied in this area since the 1970's. Identifying the observations of algal species listed in the student papers will make future research much more efficient.
Another way to apply data uncovered in this Zooniverse project is in research on bats. In recent years, White-Nose Syndrome appeared in Michigan and has been killing bats. In 2018, researchers counted bats with the same methodology as a 2014 study to compare. If there are earlier counts as well, UMBS student papers could contain the data. These counts would inform research as additional points of comparison.
History of the Biological Station Land
The University of Michigan Biological Station was founded on Douglas Lake in northern Michigan in 1909 when faculty-student teams began investigations of northern Michigan plants and animals and chronicled the recoveries of forest lands and water following the heavy industrial logging of the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. Biological Station land and nearly all land in northern Michigan, is the traditional home of the Annishinaabeg people, known also as the Ottawa, Chippewa, and Potawatomie tribes."

Saving endangered animals with science from the stars
Do you want to help save endangered animals using drones? Of course you do!
Now tell us, how many spider monkeys are there in this tree?
Sadly even with a drone its not always easy to find the animals we're looking for.
Have another go with this thermal infrared image instead!
(There are 9 monkeys - they are the bright yellow blobs.)
With a thermal camera we can see animals really easily thanks to their body heat. And in the thermal data animals glow in the same way that stars and galaxies glow. So we can use astronomy techniques to find them automatically. Astro-ecology is a world first collaboration between astronomers and conservation ecologists to help monitor and protect endangered animals.

In infrared images animals (rhinos on the left) glow in a similar way to objects in space (cluster of galaxies on the right).
We're developing a system that can find the animals, and also poachers, and can tell the difference between different species of animals based on their unique thermal fingerprint. This system will run onboard the thermal drone and will allow us to find and catch poachers in real time, and gain a very accurate understanding of vulnerable animal species so that conservationists can figure out the best way to protect them.
So far we think our system is OK at finding the animals but it needs some training to be able to tell them apart. Some objects that are obvious to the human eye are not so obvious to the computer. We need your help to make sure that we are detecting all the animals in our data and that our algorithms can identify different species correctly.
This is our algorithm identifying for chimps at Chester Zoo.

As our research incorporates different scientific disciplines, the background of our team is split between biology, imaging, and computer science.
We work with many different types of 3D imaging data. Right now, we're working with data from a technique called Cryo Electron Tomography (see below for more information) to answer questions about how cells change during a virus infection.

Aerial view of Diamond Light Source on the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus in South Oxfordshire, UK.
What virus are we studying?
The virus we're working with here is a Reovirus. Reoviruses belong to a large family of viruses that infect a wide range of animals and plants. Some members of the family cause widespread disease, notably Rotaviruses, which are responsible for serious gastroenteritis. In contrast, reoviruses themselves, whilst they pervasively infect humans, do not typically produce symptoms, indeed they are being trialled as possible anti-cancer agents, since they specifically replicate in many cancer cells activated for division. They are therefore a good starting point to try to understand the life-cycle of this family of viruses.
What is a virus factory, and why are we studying them?
By virus standards Reoviruses are quite large and are made up of several layers of different protein subunits that self-assemble (capturing and protecting the genome of the virus in the process) in factory-like structures that appear in an infected cell just a few hours after infection. As time goes on particles are released from the cell in increasing numbers, as triple-layered particles. These particles have been isolated, purified and their detailed structure determined. They are icosahedral, which means that the protein subunits are arranged in a symmetrical way, simplifying the problem of self-assembling hundreds of protein subunits to form the virus’s coat.

Detailed structures of reovirus at two different stages. These structures were determined by averaging together many copies of each stage of the virus to reveal details of the structure.
What we are doing now is to use cryo-electron tomography to visualise virus particles in very thin slices cut from infected cells that have been frozen. Our aim is, ultimately, to understand the full life cycle, how the virus gets into the cell, replicates, assembles more copies of itself and finally leaves the cell. In the 3D pictures here we have taken a snapshot 12 hours after infection and are aiming to visualise intermediate steps in the assembly process which have not been visible before, and to then work out how virus assembly is organised in time and space within the cell. Within this snapshot, there will be multiple stages of the virus.
Here are some example cartoons and reference images of each of the stages:
The earliest stage is the star-like structure (leftmost in image above). This is the newly formed, empty shell of the virus.
The next stage is the circular, but still empty structure (2nd from the left in image above). This is the expanded form ready to be filled with the RNA genome of the virus.
Next is the same circular, but now filled structure (3rd from the left in image above). This is the virus filled with its RNA genome.
Last, is the circular, filled virus with a membrane around it (rightmost in image above). This is the fully packaged, enveloped virus.
How do we take images of cells in 3D?
Electron Tomography is a technique that allows us to collect many different tilted images of the same sample and then later piece everything back together into a 3D volume. This important technique gives us a more life-like picture of what things looks like, even very small things like viruses inside of a cell. We're using this technique at very cold temperatures with the help of the cryogen liquid nitrogen. For more information about tomography, watch the video below!
Before the data can be collected using cryo electron tomography, we had to prepare these cells by first freezing them and then using another technique called Focused Ion Beam Milling or FIB Milling for short. This technique uses an ion beam to remove parts of the cell that we're not interested in imaging, leaving only a small slab of the cell that we're interested in. This slab has to be really thin, otherwise we couldn't use electron tomography to see through it. All of this is done at very cold temperatures using liquid nitrogen!
Here's a picture describing the whole process of preparing the cells: freezing them (in liquid ethane) and then milling them using the FIB to leave just a thin slab (lamella)."

The Mountain Zebra National Park (MZNP), 28,412 hectares in size, is situated in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa and is found in a transitional area between the Grassland, Nama Karoo and Albany Thicket biomes. The uniqueness of this transitional area means the MZNP conserves important ecological processes. It is one of four National Parks, including Addo Elephant, Camdeboo and Karoo, that forms part of the Frontier cluster of the South African National Parks. The MZNP has been inhabited by humans from as far back as 14 000 years ago and boasts examples of their ancient stone artefacts and rock art. In 1937 the MZNP was proclaimed to conserve a population of endangered Cape mountain zebra, subsequently contributing greatly towards the persistence of this species. The threats posed to the MZNP’s ability to conserve its fauna and flora include conflicting land uses, inappropriate management of large herbivores and fire.
Fauna
The habitats within Mountain Zebra National Park support a variety of large mammalian species, some of which were present when the park was proclaimed and others which have been reintroduced in accordance with the objective of restoring the diversity of mammals that occurred historically. For example, buffalo were reintroduced in 1998 followed by black rhinoceros and gemsbok in 2002. Caracal were the primary carnivores in the park until the first large carnivore introduction of four cheetahs in 2007. Brown hyenas were reintroduced as the primary scavengers in 2008. Three lions were introduced in 2013, but just over a year later the female lion was returned to Karoo National Park, leaving only the two male lions which were sourced from Welgevonden Game Reserve. Since the proclamation of the park, the herbivore guild has been effectively restored and any future reintroductions will be restricted to carnivores.
Flora
The three main vegetation types found in Mountain Zebra National Park are the Karoo Escarpment Grassland, Eastern Upper Karoo, and Eastern Cape Escarpment Thicket. The Eastern Upper Karoo is characterized by flat and gently sloping plains interspersed with hills and rocky areas where the dominant flora is dwarf shrubs. The Karoo Escarpment Grassland is characterized by low mountains and hills with wiry tussock grasslands and mountain wire grass being the dominant flora. The Eastern Cape Escarpment Thicket is characterized by steeply sloping escarpment and mountain slopes with medium-high and semi-open to closed thicket where the dominant flora is the olive tree.
Translocating the Brown Hyena
Translocations of large carnivores is a common phenomenon throughout Africa, however, post-release monitoring in order to determine the success and/or failure of the translocations has rarely occurred. The conversion of large areas of agricultural land into game farming and conservation areas in the Eastern Cape, South Africa led to a large number of predators being reintroduced into various fenced reserves. Brown hyenas are one of the predators which have been reintroduced into the Eastern Cape, and the earliest reintroduction was of three individuals in 1985 into the Great Fish River Complex. However, the brown hyena remains one of the least studied large carnivores in South Africa. The most recent reintroduction of brown hyenas into the Eastern Cape was that of three individuals in 2008 into the Mountain Zebra National Park. However, no research had been conducted on the success of the reintroduction of these brown hyenas into Mountain Zebra. Therefore, Mountain Zebra provided the perfect opportunity to broaden our understanding of the role that brown hyenas play in an enclosed system. We wanted to estimate the density of brown hyenas in an enclosed reserve and to provide information on their distribution and feeding ecology. This was achieved by conducting a comprehensive camera trapping survey and scat analysis.

The park is located on an extinct volcano referred to as the Pilanesberg National Park Alkaline Ring Complex, one of the largest volcanic complexes of its type in the world, featuring rare rock types and formations. Further, its position within the transition zone between the Kalahari Desert, an arid savannah, and wetter Lowveld vegetation results in unique overlaps of mammals, birds, and vegetation.

In 1979, the Karoo National Park (Karoo NP), currently 88,700 hectares in size, was proclaimed. Situated in the Western Cape province of South Africa, it aims to preserve a representative sample of the arid Nama Karoo biome. It is one of four National Parks, including Addo Elephant, Camdeboo and Mountain Zebra, that forms part of the Frontier cluster of the South African National Parks.
The Nuweveld mountain range forms the northern boundary of the Karoo NP, creating a distinctive topographical gradient within the reserve. This topographical gradient has led to a surprising amount of diversity in the reserve, with 58 mammals and over 200 bird species recorded, as well as a multitude of reptilian species. Conflicting land use is the greatest threat posed to the Karoo NP’s ability to conserve its fauna and flora.

In response to the urgent need for more accurate assessment of mammal occupancy and populations we are launching a new research project called Snapshot Safari – South Africa. The aim of the Snapshot Safari – South Africa project is to provide extensive mammal occupancy and distribution data from conservation priority areas in South Africa as well as to develop and test survey methodology and conservation effectiveness assessments. This study will investigate how the structure and abundance of mammal communities, influenced by natural as well as anthropogenic processes, affects mammal species diversity and assemblages.
Snapshot Safari – South Africa represents an unprecedented network of camera trap grids in dozens of protected areas and protected area expansion areas in South Africa to provide continuous monitoring of population sizes and trends of all the larger (>10 kg) mammal species at each site. Some of the participating study areas are managed as conservancies and stewardship areas, some are privately owned, some are state-run, and others are under communal tenure. With the help of accurate camera trap censuses, and innovative mapping approaches we will identify which sites are being managed successfully - and hence which conservation strategies should be incorporated into a toolbox for effective wildlife management.
Snapshot Safari – South Africa will enable us to closely examine questions of species occupancy, species coexistence, competition, trophic interactions, the effect of change, and other ecological relationships across a variety of habitat types, community compositions, and management strategies. It will further provide a solid baseline for future monitoring of change as well as anthropogenic impacts. The results will contribute to the development and refinement of important methods to conserve species and ecosystems.
In addition to methods for calculating population size, camera traps also allow for a greater understanding of key demographic parameters. For example, using images of young animals, we gain information about breeding seasonality and duration, % females with young, and mortality of young. All of these are key parameters critical for both conservation management and conservation planning. Furthermore, the camera trap data are an important resource for understanding distribution and temporal occupancy for different mammal communities. Our data will document occupancy across seasons and years, allowing us to gain an understanding of seasonal occupancy.
The full data set that will be developed will be an important resource for future researchers and managers to study or gain information on environmental change, species dynamics, biodiversity patterns, species conservation status, conservation management, biodiversity planning and protected area monitoring."

A fraction of these are artifacts (bogus). This project is to mark such bogus objects apart from real/genuine (astronomically varying) sources. You can help us do that. The classifications here will form input to machine learning algorithms. Once trained, the machine learning algorithm will provide a 'real'-ness to each object, a number between 0 and 1, called the RB-score. Improving the machine learning performance at all magnitudes and in crowded fields will help the ZTF project achieve its science goals. Real objects are of two types: (a) transients that are not persistent, and (b) variables that vary in brightness but are always detected. Bogus objects for the purpose of this exercise also come in two flavors: (a) artifacts from the instrumental setup, and (b) astronomical objects with subtraction artifacts. Details on how real and bogus objects look are in the tutorial and the field guide. Please take a look before starting.

171;COSMIC;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/wkiri/cosmic/about/research;"Current space challenges
The exploration of space, arguably the most remarkable undertaking in human history, has improved our scientific and technical knowledge, inspired current and future generations, and fundamentally transformed our perspectives on who we are, where we live, and how we fit into the grand scheme of the universe. We make new discoveries about our planetary neighbors on a continual basis.
One of the challenges in space exploration is the extremely small amount of data that can be sent between Earth and a distant spacecraft. Because keeping humans alive in space is so expensive and difficult, most space missions are in effect highly specialized robots. It's very easy for a robot to take a lot of data with a camera or scientific instrument... far too much to send home. While questions like, ""Do the images look reasonable?"" ""Which ten images are the important ones to send to Earth?"" ""What surprising changes or new findings did you observe?"" are understandable to a human expert, traditional programming makes coding these abilities into robots very challenging. From the days of Explorer I all the way to today, most missions follow the concept ""Send the data directly to Earth, don't collect more than you can send, and let the humans decide what to collect next."" This approach is generally effective, but it can lead to idle time in which the spacecraft is waiting on new instructions, and it precludes the ability to capture and respond to dynamic or transient events (like dust devils or cryovolcanic plumes).
New capabilities through data-driven science
Using machine learning (ML), we can train a system to model what the scientists think is interesting onboard. Then, in addition to what the scientists have manually requested, the spacecraft can continue to scan its environment looking for ""likely interesting"" findings to offer the scientists on the next communication pass. This is called onboard autonomy, and it's important to note that it does not (cannot) replace the scientist. Instead, it offers the experts back home a list of possible interesting observations, the same way that a mapping program on your phone might offer you similar nearby restaurants or highly rated similar products. The onboard ML has the luxury of processing the high-resolution instrument data in-situ, without worrying about transmission bandwidth back to Earth. Then, once it's made its best guess at what scientists might like to see, it lets them know what they could request. This new framework of science-supporting ML autonomy can be summarized as ""Observe as much as possible and return the best,"" rather than the old mantra: ""Observe these targets and nothing more.""
Monitoring rather than occasional probing
With the Content-based Object Summarization to Monitor Infrequent Change (COSMIC) project, we aim to inform the development of future Mars orbital spacecraft with cameras like the HiRISE instrument currently onboard MRO. What if we could leave such a super-high-resolution imager on continuously and analyze all of the science data onboard, sending home a prioritized list of what is discovered? Specifically, for COSMIC this means inventorying signs of recent and ongoing surface activity like new craters created by meteorite impacts, springtime blasts of escaping gas as dry ice hidden beneath the surface sublimates, and many more. Scientists know that these phenomena are happening, but so far these discoveries have been happy accidents or careful campaigns tracking a handful of ""likely places."" A system like COSMIC could monitor the whole planet, building up a huge catalog of interesting events and landmark features."
172;Local Group Cluster Search;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/lcjohnso/local-group-cluster-search/about/research;"Welcome to the Local Group Cluster Search!
The goal of this project is to identify star clusters in the Triangulum galaxy (Messier 33 or M33), the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) -- three galaxies in the Local Group, our galactic neighborhood. We are searching images obtained by the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on the Hubble Space Telescope and the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the Blanco 4-m at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO).
Star Cluster Science
Star clusters are collections of hundreds to millions of stars that were born at the same time from the same cloud of gas. This shared origin makes star clusters unique tools for understanding how stars form and evolve. Additionally, they are useful for studying the major chapters in the formation history of a galaxy. But before we can unlock these secrets, we need the help of citizen scientists to find the clusters.
Star clusters vary greatly in terms of mass, size, age, and local environment. As a result, star clusters can appear quite different from one another depending on the properties of the clusters and where they are located in the galaxy. This makes the process of identifying clusters tricky and difficult to automate. We hope that you will help us find the thousands of star clusters hiding in the survey data!
After you help us to find these star clusters, we will determine the properties of these systems, including their ages and masses. We will use the age-dated cluster sample to study a host of interesting topics: rapid and rare stages of stellar evolution, the structure and scale of star formation, the evolution of cluster populations, and how the cluster's host galaxies have changed over billions of years.
Local Group Galaxy Targets
This project focuses on three nearby galaxies: the Triangulum Galaxy (M33), the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Along with our own Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), these five galaxies are the most massive galaxies in the Local Group -- a collection of galaxies that reside inside a sphere with a ~4 million light year diameter. M33 and the LMC both have stellar masses that are approximately 10% of the stellar mass of the Milky Way, while the SMC is significantly smaller (0.4% of Milky Way stellar mass).
The relatively small distances (in astronomical terms!) to the three target galaxies allows us to obtain detailed images where individual stars can be detected within the galaxy and its star clusters. The ability to spatially resolve individual cluster members is helpful in identifying clusters as well as determining cluster ages.

Synthetic Clusters
The appearance of star clusters vary greatly, so it is important for us to measure which kinds of clusters we can successfully identify. For this reason, we have inserted realistic synthetic clusters with known ages, masses, and sizes into some of the images. By identifying both real and synthetic clusters, we will learn what types of clusters are detectable in each of the target galaxies. This information is critical for understanding the age and mass distributions of the clusters by allowing us to determine whether certain populations of clusters do not exist or if they are simply avoiding detection. Having you find these clusters is just as important for many of our science goals as the real clusters!
These synthetic clusters are also a way to provide some feedback on how you’re doing with cluster identification. Unlike the real clusters, we know where these objects are located in the image ahead of time. That allows us to tell you when you’ve correctly identified a synthetic cluster. If you’re finding the synthetic clusters, you are likely identifying new, real clusters as well!"

Welcome to Planet Hunters TESS. With your help, we can discover new planets around stars outside of our own Solar System!
The recently launched Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is providing us with a huge amount of data that lets us look for planets outside of our own Solar System. Over the next two years TESS will be busy surveying two-hundred-thousand bright nearby stars, measuring and recording their brightness every two minutes. With your help, we hope to uncover lots of interesting planetary systems, allowing us to explore the formation and evolution of these worlds. Our findings may even bring us one step closer to answering the question that we all seek to answer: Are we alone in the Universe?

What is an Exoplanet?

Exoplanets are planets beyond our own Solar System that orbit stars other than the Sun. The drastic improvement in telescopes in the last 50 years has enabled us to find thousands of exoplanets since the first one was discovered in the late 20th century. Whilst many of these found exoplanets resemble the planets found in the Solar System, we have also come across strange systems including gigantic planets in orbits close to their star (called Hot Jupiters) and planets that orbit multiple stars (circumbinary planets).
How do we detect Planets?
It is extremely difficult to see exoplanets directly, even with the largest telescopes. This is because the planets are hidden in the bright light given off by their host star. Instead, we can infer their presence by monitoring the starlight.
TESS records how the brightness of individual stars varies over time. This time series of brightness measurements is known as a lightcurve. When an exoplanet passes, or transits, in front of its host star, the star momentarily dims and we see a dip in its lightcurve. This method of detecting planets is known as the Transit Method and has already proven to be extremely effective.
Here is a simplified example of what the lightcurve from a transit looks like. It shows that as the planet passes in front of its host star, the light that we receive decreases.
Photo credits: Nora Eisner
In order for us to be able to observe a transit we require the planetary system to be oriented so that the planet passes between us and the host star (as shown on the right hand side of the image below). If this is the case, we will see a dip every time that the planet completes one full orbit around the star. If the planet does not cross our line of sight, we will miss the transit (shown on the left).

This short video shows the behaviour of the lightcurve as a planet passes in front of a star:

The size of the dip in the lightcurve depends both on the size of the star and on the size of the planet. First, for a single sized star, if the transiting planet is larger it will block out more starlight, and thus the dip in the lightcurve will be larger. Conversely, for the same sized planet, if the star is larger (for example a G dwarf like the Sun) the transit will be shallower than if the star is smaller (for example an M dwarf).
Photo credits: Nora Eisner
The depths of transits can vary greatly. Jupiter, the largest planet in our Solar System, has a transit depth of about 1% when it passes in front of the Sun. Earth, however, is a much smaller planet and only blocks out 0.01% of the light when it transits the Sun! The numbers on the vertical axis of the lightcurve plots shown in the project represent the percentage decrease in light with respect to the average light given off by the star. With knowledge of the transit depth and the size of the star, we can work out the size of the planet using this equation:
In our Solar System we have eight various sized planets. It therefore should come as no surprise that other stars can also host multiple worlds. The lightcurves of such exoplanetary-systems show multiple transits from the different planets, which are likely to have different depths due to their different sizes. They are also likely to be separated irregularly, as different planets orbit around stars at different rates - just like the planets in our Solar System (Jupiter takes 12 times longer than Earth to complete one orbit). An example lightcurve is shown below. If you see a multi-planet system, please highlight all the transits that you see.
A well studied multi-planet system is Trappist-1, which has seven planets orbiting around a star 100 trillion kilometers away from Earth. The fact that we can see the Trappist planets is incredible. To put this into perspective, seeing the Trappist-1 transits is equivalent to us detecting a fruit fly passing just in front of a car headlamp that is located over half way between us and the moon. But we can do it!

Stars
The vast majority of stars are not alone, but instead exist in double, or even triple systems of stars that orbit around one another. When one of these stars passes in front of another (as seen by us), the brightness that we observe changes, similar to what happens during a planet transit. This is known as an eclipsing binary. Lightcurves due to an eclipsing binary will often exhibit two different sized dips.
If you do see a lightcurve with an eclipsing binary, please mark this as a transit and tell us about it in Talk.
Stellar Variability
To complicate things further, we also see changes in brightness due to the variability of the star. Stars have starspots just as the Sun has sunspots, and as they rotate with the star they result in periodic fluctuations in the observed brightness. These variations tend to be slow and smooth, typically occurring over a couple of days. Conversely, we expect planets to transit at a much quicker pace, in just a few to tens of hours, resulting in narrower dips in the lightcurves.
Stars can also pulsate. This is when the radius of the star changes over time, and thus the brightness fluctuates. This effect ranges from being very rapid, on the timescales of a few hours, to extremely low, on the timescale of years.

TESS launched on April 18, 2018, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, and now orbits around the Earth at twice the rate of the Moon. Over the next two years, this amazing new satellite will observe the entire sky by breaking it up into 26 different sectors. Each sector is stared at by four extremely powerful cameras, together covering a patch of sky with dimensions of 24 by 96 degrees. You can find out exactly where the satellite is pointing at in link. The stars in each of these sectors will be monitored for at least 27 days, recording their brightness every 2 minutes.

Watch this video to find out more about how TESS works:
Systematic Effects
TESS is great, but no system is perfect, so there are some systematic effects that can be seen around the same time in multiple lightcurves. These often shows up as increasingly scattered data points, or a sudden jump in the lightcurve. We saw many of these in the Sector one and two data, however, their frequency and severity continue to decrease as we learn more about how TESS works.
Each time the satellite downlinks data to Earth, which happens around the 14-day mark, and lasts about 4 hours, the conditions of the satellite can change slightly - e.g. due to changes in temperature of the equipment. This causes a 'glitch' in the observations and thus we are not showing these data. Furthermore, the data points surrounding this 'masked' region of the lightcurve may also exhibit some strange behaviour. We are calling these focus events.
Simulated Data
One of our primary goals from the Planet Hunters TESS project is to find out more about the diversity of planets, and to understand what kind of solar systems exist. We will find many planetary systems with Planet Hunters TESS, but in order to correctly interpret our results we need to understand how complete our sample is. For example, very small planets are very difficult to find and we might not see any in the TESS data, but this does not mean that they do not exist.
In order to determine what kind of planets we can and can't find with Planet Hunters TESS, we occasionally show you a simulated lightcurve. As it is simulated, we know all the parameters of the lightcurve, including the depth of the transit, the orbital period of the planet, and the variability of the star. The results from the simulated data are essential for defining the completeness of our planets as a function of size (depth of the transit event) and the orbital period (number of transits). This is a crucial part of the project that allows us to answer some of the most interesting and fundamental questions of how planets and solar systems form.
Please remember that we are not testing you or trying to train you; we are testing the system in order to allow us to correctly interpret all of your classifications. We will always tell you when you encounter a simulation after you classified it - we tell you that it's a simulation after, and not before, to ensure that no bias is introduced. Simulations also gives us a chance to give you some feedback on your classification. You will get many classifications right so please don't be discouraged if you missed some transits, some simulated transits are purposely very difficult to spot, and that result will help us analyse the overall results.
The feedback will look like the image below, where a green column means you correctly marked a transit, and a red columns means that you missed one. Sometimes the transits are so small that they are impossible to see, this happens when the planet is very small compared to the host star. The variability of the star will also make them increasingly more difficult to see. The number of simulations that you see will decrease as you do more classifications.
Why we need you
Scientists from around the world have developed extremely efficient computer algorithms that will look for repeated signals in TESS's lightcurves. Such techniques have already proven to be extremely efficient at finding planets, however there is only so much that a machine can do. Planetary systems are highly complex, and their lightcurves are never quite the same. This, combined with the variability of the stars, can confuse our computer algorithms, yielding wrong results or missing planetary systems entirely. Human brains, however, are excellent at detecting patterns that automated routines may miss, and that is why we need your help!
To date, Planet Hunters volunteers found over 100 new planetary systems in data from TESS's predecessor, Kepler, and we are excited to find even more with the TESS data. Will the next planet be discovered by you?

The 25,926 men and women represented by these cards comprise what former President William Howard Taft called ""one of the greatest achievements of peace in all the history of human warfare.""
From 1914 to 1918, the conflict that would come to be known as the First World War ensnared twenty-eight nations with a total population count of 1.5 billion, or 90% of the world’s known population. Fifty-nine million men fought in World War I, resulting in 7.7 million deaths and 18.6 million injuries. By the time America entered the war in 1917, it was clear that World War I would be remembered as a great humanitarian crisis. Prior to the American entry to the war, the YMCA had been providing services to the Allied forces as well as relief to prisoners of war. This was possible due to the United States’ status as a neutral nation. When President Wilson declared America’s involvement in the war on April 6, 1917, the YMCA pledged its support. Tapping the YMCA’s legacy of service during previous conflicts, the YMCA was asked to take on nearly all human service activities for the U.S. military.
Over the next two years, the YMCA dispatched 9,475 men and 3,480 women overseas (11,306 men and 1665 women also served the homefront) to administer to the mental, spiritual, and physical needs of the Allied forces. Educators offered literacy and English instruction, and ministers provided spiritual support. General Pershing, Commander of the American Expeditionary Force, specifically asked the YMCA to organize athletic activities in order to assist in making the troops “fit to fight.” In addition to strengthening troops and providing recreation, baseball proved to be an effective means of training soldiers to throw grenades. In all, 75 million soldiers engaged in YMCA physical activities during the war.
As one of the nation’s largest and oldest social welfare institutions, the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) is a dynamic organization that has worked to improve communities around the globe for 165 years. One institution that has long benefited from the support of the YMCA is the Armed Forces, work which began in 1857 when the Portsmouth, Virginia Y started to engage with the local naval yard. The largest of the YMCA’s wartime relief efforts, measured by individuals served and dollars spent, took place during WWI. The records housed at the Kautz Family YMCA Archives, University of Minnesota Libraries provide a comprehensive account of the YMCA’s war work, both domestic and international narrating public attitudes and engagement prior to, during, and after the war-- the conditions of soldiers in training camps, on the front lines, in leave areas, and in prison camps. Furthermore, they document the variety of ways the YMCA engaged with soldiers, bringing a “bit of home over there,” through educational services, managing canteens and leave areas, providing entertainment and organizing sports including the Inter-Allied Games, providing counsel through chaplains, and distributing religious tracts.
This project seeks to shed light on these individuals and make freely available the biographical and demographic information contained within these cards by:
engaging citizen scientists in the coding of a large, currently inaccessible, collection of 25,926 punch cards containing a wealth of valuable demographic information.
providing full, open source, access to the resulting data (including raw and collated) to scholars, students, and the public at large."
175;Nebraska Wildlife Watch;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/watchablewildlife/nebraska-wildlife-watch/about/research;"Study Goals
1. To gain information that will help inform state habitat management decisions
2. To gain confirmed sightings of rare/at-risk species
3. Promote engagement of Nebraska based citizen science
4. To allow participants to view and recognize Nebraska's wildlife
This project is focused on the year-round monitoring of two Natural Legacy Project Demonstration Sites.
The Nebraska Natural Legacy Project has four goals:
1.) Reverse the decline of at-risk species
At-risk species refer to animals and plants that are in danger of extinction. Conservation is needed to keep at-risk species a part of Nebraska’s wildlife.
2.) Delist at-risk species
Conservation efforts recover species of greatest conservation need, allowing for their removal from the at-list list. Delisting of species is a sign of conservation success!
3.) Keep common species common
By keeping common species common, we ensure healthy biodiversity in Nebraska, meaning that there are many different types of plants and animals.
4.) Conserve natural communities of plants and animals
Natural communities of plants and animals refer to the broader patterns of species that live together, as well as things like soil type, water, geology, and natural processes that occur in an area. To have diverse wildlife, we must look at this bigger picture.
Natural Legacy Demonstration Sites are open to the public. These sites are managed using conservation techniques that can be utilized on both public and private lands. In addition to acting as a showcase for conservation-based land management techniques, these areas provide critical habitat for at-risk species and represent a variety of Nebraska landscapes.
Camera trapping for this project is completed year-round. Camera stations are installed to capture images of wildlife using the area. The cameras will be placed at a height of ~0.5 m. above the ground, secured to a post or tree. The cameras are checked and new images added to Zooniverse monthly."
176;The Hunt for Galaxy Clusters;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/matej-dot-kosiba/the-hunt-for-galaxy-clusters/about/research;"The Hunt for Galaxy Clusters
We are on the hunt for galaxy clusters. By understanding galaxy cluster physics, we hold one of the keys to unlock the answers to questions such as: What is the nature of the Universe we live in? How did matter in the Universe start to gravitationally collapse? How did stars start to form? How did galaxies start to form? How did galaxy clusters start to form? Galaxy clusters can also provide tests of alternative theories of gravity (e.g. MOG, MOND). All the data in The Hunt for Galaxy Clusters come from the XMM CLuster Archive Super Survey (x-class), an X-ray galaxy cluster search in the archival data of the European Space Agency's X-ray observatory, XMM-Newton.
The goal of The Hunt for Galaxy Clusters
There are many unknown galaxy clusters waiting to be discovered in our Universe. To discover them in the vast amount of space in the Universe and the huge amount of upcoming astronomical data, we need to automate this! We will create a program based on the newest machine learning techniques. To do this we need your help to classify the images of potential galaxy clusters so that we can train our galaxy cluster finder!
Why can’t computers do this task?
Even today, algorithms that created the dataset in The Hunt for Galaxy Clusters still can not properly distinguish galaxy clusters from other X-rays emitting objects (like point sources or nearby galaxies) or even from instrumental effects (like the enhancement of the X-ray emission by the chip edges and clusters hidden in high levels of background X-ray emission). Humans are generally better at finding galaxy clusters than current computer programs. We have the ability to simultaneously compare the X-ray images with the optical counterparts, which gives us more information about the cluster candidates than using the X-ray data alone. This task however is very tedious! (Image credit: Wocorcaman, deviantart)
Optical images
Oschin Schmidt Telescope
UK Schmidt Telescope
The optical images you are about to see are not coloured in the typical way that you may be used to seeing in astronomical images. Here colour represents the amount of light hitting the telescope from a certain position on the sky. The areas of darker colour represent areas on the telescopes camera that have been exposed to more light. The optical spectrum is mainly dominated by the light coming from photospheres of individual stars residing in galaxies. So what you see are mainly individual galaxies and closer stars. All of the optical images in The Hunt for Galaxy Clusters come from The Digitized Sky Survey 2 DSS2, which used the Oschin Schmidt Telescope on Palomar Mountain (images credit: Palomar/Caltech) and the UK Schmidt Telescope (images credit: Australian Astronomical Observatory).
X-ray images
You are about to see the high energy Universe as seen in the X-ray. In this wavelength, light is invisible to our naked eyes and our optical telescopes. Colour in the X-ray images represents the amount of X-rays captured by pixels on our astronomical imaging camera detector (CCD). Darker colours represent more X-ray emission arriving at the telescope. The X-ray Universe is mainly dominated by various point sources and extended X-ray emission of hot intra-cluster gas. All of the X-ray images at The Hunt for Galaxy Clusters are made by the European Space Agency's X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission XMM-Newton satellite (image credit: European Space Agency). XMM-Newton satellite was launched on December 10th 1999 and is still operating. It had to be placed out of the Earth’s atmosphere as our atmosphere blocks out X-ray light. Unlike optical telescopes, X-ray telescopes do not reflect light using classical mirrors, as the X-ray light would either move freely through the mirror of a classical telescope or get absorbed. They instead are equipped with the series of coaxial paraboloid and hyperboloid mirrors, coated by gold to enhance reflectivity. X-ray light enters almost parallel to the mirrors which slightly alter and focus the X-rays into the focal point, where they are captured by the CCDs. As the CCD detectors are not only sensitive to X-ray photons but also to IR, visible and UV light, the cameras include aluminised optical blocking filters to reduce the contamination of the X-ray signal by those photons.
Galaxy clusters
a) Introduction
Galaxy clusters are the largest structures in the Universe that are bound together by the force of gravity. They are composed of galaxies, hot gas filling the intra-cluster space and mysterious dark matter. Most of the galaxies in our Universe group into clusters. Those which are not a part of clusters are called the field galaxies. Clusters of galaxies have been found to be bright and extended X-ray sources. We now know the source of this X-ray emission is hot intra-cluster gas with temperatures of tens to hundreds of millions of degrees and low densities, ~ 7*1029 lower than density of our air. The mass of the X-ray emitting gas alone is greater than the mass of all of the cluster galaxies combined! However, the main mass component is not the mass of the intra-cluster X-ray gas, but the mass of the mysterious dark matter. If we compare the masses of all components, then ∼86% belongs to the dark matter, ∼12% belongs to the hot intra-cluster gas and only ∼2% of all mass of the galaxy clusters is in the galaxies themselves. Some alternative theories of gravity claim that dark matter does not exist. Studying galaxy clusters is one way to test these theories.
b) Importance of galaxy clusters
One of the main interests of cosmologists is to understand how the structures we see in the Universe today came into being. It is widely accepted that the Universe started at the Big Bang. In the very first moments of its life, everything was extremely hot and smooth. How did matter in the Universe start to form clumps? How did stars start to form? How did galaxies start to form? How did clusters of galaxies start to form? These are some of the most basic but nonetheless some of the hardest questions to answer. As the largest structures in the Universe bound by gravity, galaxy clusters hold the key to the formation of structures in the Universe on the largest scales. By studying them in this project, we will improve our understanding of the Universe we live in.
c) Age of objects and the speed of light
How can we know what clusters of galaxies looked like billions of years ago, when they started to form? How can we know what came before what we see now? Thanks to the finite speed of light, we do not see astronomical objects as they are in the present moment, but rather as they were at the time they produced the light. As we look further away, we see the Universe as it looked in the past. For example, the light from our Sun takes around 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach the Earth; when a solar flare occurs, we see it only after those 8 minutes and 20 seconds.
d) How do clusters of galaxies form?
Under the influence of gravity, the tiny inhomogeneities in the early Universe grew, and dark matter and ordinary matter clumped together. Together with the effects of dark energy and the expansion of the Universe, the so called ”cosmic web” was formed (see image, image credit: Springel et al. (2005)). Clusters of galaxies form where the filaments meet. Older clusters tend to have a dominant giant elliptical galaxy at their core, surrounded by other elliptical galaxies."
177;Southern Weather Discovery;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/drewdeepsouth/southern-weather-discovery/about/research;"Click below to watch the Southern Weather Discovery video and learn more about the project!
During the 19th and 20th centuries, thousands of ships sailed across the Southern Ocean. These ship voyages included cargo transport, emigration from the Old World to the New World, hunting for resources (e.g. whales), as well as epic missions of exploration and scientific discovery.
Even in the face of constant hardship during tough conditions, these sailors and explorers recorded weather observations for navigation and scientific purposes. Our team has uncovered thousands of old ship log books and records from Antarctic explorations in archives around the world, which is a tremendous resource for climate science.
We need your help to get old Southern Ocean and Antarctic weather data off the pages in old log books and fed into a super-computer, which will bring them to life in a daily weather animation for Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.
With your help, we can use that animation to better understand past weather patterns and evaluate historic climate trends from a region we know little about.
Are you ready to help us find data treasure from the waters surrounding Antarctica?
Let's go!!
What does a logbook page actually look like?
The image above is an example of what one of the ship logbook pages looks like - this one is from the MS Durham, on a journey from Wellington, New Zealand to London, United Kingdom, via Cape Horn in 1938.
There is a huge amount of weather information on each page. Most days, four observations were made for many different climate variables. Our research has prioritised certain climate variables for recovery at this stage: sea level pressure, temperature, and sea ice observations. We also need to record the location of the observations (latitude and longitude) so we can reconstruct the weather of that point in time and space.
We have made rescuing the weather observations much easier by clipping each logbook page into smaller images, which you can see when you have a go at keying the data yourself. That way it's much easier to keep track of the numbers you're entering, rather than getting lost among a sea of numbers!"

179;Wild Wolf Watch;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/mlsmax/wild-wolf-watch/about/research;"What's a Red Wolf?
The critically endangered red wolf, Canis rufus, is one of two officially recognized species of wolves in North America. Red wolves are intermediate in size between the larger Gray Wolf (Canis lupus) and the smaller Coyote (Canis latrans). For thousands of years, long before European settlers arrived, the Red Wolf roamed as a top predator from the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, north to southern Ontario and west to Missouri and central Texas.
By the 1920s, however, the Red Wolf had largely disappeared from most of its historic range. Indiscriminate killing, along with large-scale government predator control programs and the destruction of habitat, critically threatened the continued survival of this unique species. The few remaining Red Wolves, unable to find mates of their own species, began to interbreed with coyotes, further accelerating the Red Wolf’s decline.
Finally, only a small remnant population of red wolves remained in an area of marginal habitat in western coastal Louisiana and eastern Texas. In an effort to save the species, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) live-trapped over 400 canids and placed them in a pioneer captive breeding program. Of these 400 canids, only 14 were determined to be pure red wolves, and these 14 became the founders of the current wild and captive red wolf populations.
In 1987, four pairs of red wolves were released in the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge in northeastern North Carolina. Under intense management by a skilled team of USFWS field biologists, red wolf numbers slowly but steadily increased, and by 2005, an estimated 130 red wolves lived in the 5 counties of the red wolf restoration region on the Albemarle Peninsula.
However, because of intense pressure from a few wolf opponents and from the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, the USFWS ceased many of its successful management practices, and gunshot mortality increased as well. As a result, red wolf numbers plummeted as packs were fractured. At present (2017), fewer than 30 red wolves remain in the wild. Wolf opponents continue to publicly claim that red wolves are a threat to humans and domestic animals and that they have caused the decline of other wildlife species in the red wolf recovery region. These claims are demonstrably false. Here’s where citizen science comes in!
What's This Project About?
Citizens of all ages hold the keys to wildlife and wild lands conservation. In order to preserve and protect the red wolf, the public must advocate for this animal in a variety of ways. One major way to become actively engaged is to assist in dismantling the false claim by wolf opponents that red wolves have caused the sharp decline of other wildlife species in the 5-county red wolf recovery region.
How do we assess wildlife numbers and biodiversity? There are various strategies, but the use of motion-sensitive cameras can be an effective tool. We have learned a great deal about red wolves in the past 40 years, including how they hunt and what they eat. They prey on white-tail deer, raccoons, the invasive nutria, marsh rabbits, squirrels, and small rodents.
Do these animals, as well as others such as black bears and bobcats, thrive in healthy numbers on the Albemarle Peninsula? It is our expectation that data from this project will:
• Help give a fuller and more detailed picture of resident wildlife in red wolf country, both in terms of numbers and variety of species.
• Encourage public acceptance and tolerance for canid predators by documenting the presence of a wide range of wildlife species.
• Demonstrate that healthy numbers of a variety of wildlife species live and thrive on the Albemarle Peninsula.
• Encourage interest in the use of camera traps by private citizens to document the presence of wildlife on their own properties."
180;Variable Star Zoo;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/ilacerna/variable-star-zoo/about/research;"The VISTA Variables in the Vía Láctea (VVV) survey is an ESO Public Survey that is mapping the central region of the Milky Way, that we call the “bulge”, in near infrared light. It is also acquiring ~100 repeated exposure in the Ks band, so we can construct a movie of the sky.
One of the key goals of the VVV Survey is to identify new variables stars, i.e., stars whose brightness changes periodically with time. Many of them are stars that expand and contract, as if they were breathing, such as RR Lyrae, Cepheids or Miras. Each of these stars breath (we say that they “pulsate”) only during a very specific phase of their evolution, corresponding to a very specific internal stratification that we understand and are able to model very well. Once we identify one of these variables, we can predict what is their real luminosity, their mass and their age.
The real luminosity, i.e., the energy they produce per second, allows us to derive their distance, by comparison with their apparent luminosity. Distances are of paramount importance in astronomy, because they allow us to go from our two-dimensional view of the night sky to a three-dimensional representation of our Galaxy in space. On the other hand, their age will give us information about when did star formation occur in that region of the Milky Way. Hence it will tell us how did the inner Galaxy form.
In order to identify one of these variables, we look at the period and the shape of their luminosity (or brightness) change versus time, also known as “light curve”. However some variables have similar light curves, that are not easy to tell apart with automatized software. In addition, some variables have light curves similar to those of binary stars. The latter do not change their individual luminosity, but the total light we see might change because they periodically eclipse each other.
We have millions of light curves for variables that we have not yet identified. Here we have uploaded thousands of them to be classified. Because no automatized software does a better job than your brain (they are faster, but not smarter) perhaps you can lend us a few of your neurons for a short period of time, and help us with the task of identifying what kind of variable star we are looking at. You will be contributing to the mapping of the 3D inner structure of the Galaxy we live in, and to the understanding of when the stars we see on a dark night formed."
181;The Wilds' Wildlife Watch;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/thewilds/the-wilds-wildlife-watch/about/research;"What is The Wilds?
The Wilds is a 10,000 acre conservation center located in southeastern Ohio. Together with the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium we work to conserve animal species. Historically, this area was surface mined for coal during the 1940's to the early 1980's. As a result, The Wilds is a mixture of unmined remnant forest, abandoned mined lands, and reclaimed prairie and grassland. The area is currently protected and much of it is being restored for native plants and wildlife. However, many of the reclaimed areas and abandoned minelands are characterized by invasive species and acid mine drainage. We are working towards removing invasive species and planting a variety of native species, both in prairies and in forests, to help improve the habitat at The Wilds for all of Ohio's native wildlife.
Why monitor wildlife?
Monitoring wildlife is an important part of restoration and wildlife ecology and research. The species we find indicates ecosystem health. We can use photos to estimate the overall occurrence of wildlife species on site. Photos may also show how species respond to both the disturbance history and our restoration efforts. An integral part of our mission is to restore quality habitat for native Ohio wildlife species. We also monitor for more rare species in this area, such as foxes and bears.
The Project
At The Wilds we have set up 48 wildlife cameras in our forested areas. These cameras are standard, motion-sensored trail cameras that many people use for hunting and monitoring wildlife. This is a non-invasive way to monitor wildlife on our property. As you can imagine, we get quite a lot of pictures from 48 cameras. That's where you come in to help! We need to identify the animals in each picture. We have thousands of images, so every classification helps! Your input will be used to create a database of wildlife found at The Wilds. They will be analyzed based on camera location for species density and richness."
182;Beluga Bits;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/stephenresearch/beluga-bits/about/research;"So much we don't know
Hudson Bay is home to more than 50 thousand beluga during the summer! Along the western side of the bay, there are 3 major river estuaries where beluga gather in the thousands. They have spent the winter in waters that are covered in ice and are hundreds of kilometres to the north. When the sea ice melts in the spring each year beluga travel to estuaries but it is not fully clear what benefits they gain in these areas. The estuaries may provide a safe refuge from killer whales, they may provide warmer water to help molt their skin, or it may be a combination of these and other factors. One thing we do know is that in the Churchill River Estuary beluga whales are close enough to peek into their underwater world and ask questions about beluga social structure, interactions with small boats, and their natural history.
How we get beluga photographs
Here are our major research themes that you will be helping us with
1. Social Structure
Are the same groups of animals always seen together?
Using the age and sex results we hope to answer this. We predict that we will only see calves with groups of females but we are also interested in related questions like if only adult males form groups or do male groups include all age classes?
Are the same individuals always seen together?
Using the data on marked individuals we hope to answer this and build a picture of which animals are socially connected to which other animals. For example, if we see a marked calf with a female in one year then see it again in subsequent years, it could indicate a matrilineal pod structure (females are the core of a group), which is seen in many whale species.
2. Life History
How often do females have calves?
Although examination of the reproductive tracts of beluga whales suggests that females will have a calf every two to three years on average, there some uncertainty in this estimate. Using the data on marked females with calves we hope to understand the calving rate better and that will help to estimate the population growth rate.
What sort of threats face beluga whales?
The types of scars on whales can be very informative. For example, in bowhead whales, researchers have documented increases in predation by killer whales from rake marks.
How strong is the urge to return to this estuary (site fidelity)
We think that beluga return to the same estuary each year and because of this we might be able to manage the population based on these Estuaries. However, it is difficult to figure this out. One way is to put satellite transmitters on beluga and track where they are going but so far no transmitter has lasted an entire year. We hope that by identifying marked individuals year after year we can figure this question out.
3. Habitat Use
Do belugas of a certain age or sex tend to use the same underwater habitat?
When the beluga boat is driving around the estuary it is also collecting GPS locations of its position. We will then link the classified photos to a location in the river. This will allow us to look at questions related to habitat use like do beluga tend to be found at a certain water depth maybe just in areas with a particular bottom (sand, gravel, boulders)."
183;1961 Census;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/dataliberation/1961-census/about/research;"The 1961 UK Census is a uniquely valuable record of our society at a time of great social change in the UK. However, much of the 1961 Census data remains in microfilm format, which makes them inaccessible and useless for modern analyses.
This project aims to breathe new life into the data by retrieving and processing content from the Office for National Statistics 1961 Census Image Library. We want to make these data publicly available as a digital dataset, allowing people to use these data for their research.
Individual census records are confidential for 100 years, so we are not dealing with any census data that can identify an individual. We are dealing with data which has been aggregated to an area, for example the number of divorced males aged 30-34 living in Battersea.
We are processing 1961 English and Welsh data. These data have been digitised at different geographical areas, such as Districts, Wards and Enumeration Districts.
The image below shows a 1961 Census printout. It contains several tables which give information about a particular area, such as the number of households without hot water, or the number of people born in Cyprus.
We produced templates for all of these tables with regions for each cell. These allow us to “cookie cut” the values (persons, households, dwellings, rooms, establishments, etc.) into a data file.
As part of the template we assigned each variable a unique ID. Here you can see the template for one table (SH13 - Age and Marital Condition by Five Year Age Groups):
Using cutting edge OCR (Optical Character Recognition) techniques we have been able to extract around 97% of the values, but we need help with the remaining 3%, which the OCR either hasn’t recognised, or where we know there are errors due to discrepancies. This is why many of the values people check look fairly easy to interpret. This is where the Zooniverse site comes in. It’s a simple task, we are asking people to type what they see in the box (or most closely associated with the box):
You can see examples and further information in the tutorial, which can be found in the Classify section.
We are also undertaking work to compare values and identify inconsistencies:
Comparing values within tables, e.g. ensuring that the “all people” value is the sum of all of the individual age bands
Comparing identical values between tables, for example a value for “all females” will appear in numerous tables.
Comparing values of a higher geography with the sum of all of the lower geographies (e.g. the values for Hammersmith, should be the sum of all of the Hammersmith wards). These checks allow us to identify any inconsistencies
This work helps us to target additional QA (Quality Assurance) work effectively, so we are only asking people to check what really needs to be checked.
What sort of topics do these data cover?
The 1961 tables that we’re processing include the following information:
Tenure for households, persons, and rooms
Building types
Residents born outside of the UK (9 categories by Sex)
Nationalities by sex (UK citizens, Other British, European nationalities, Other aliens)
Non-private populations (excluding hotels) by sex and institution type
Household by amenities (sharing / lacking: cold water; hot water; Fixed bath; WC)
Pensioners living alone by Sex
Pensioners living in two person households by sex
Hotels by number of rooms (including number of staff, relatives of staff, resident guests, and resident visitors)
Non-private households by age and sex
Number of persons per room (by households, with kitchen, without exclusive use of stove and sink)
Persons resident outside of the Local Authority area by sex
Age and marital status by sex and five year age groups
Single years of age by sex for under 21 year olds
Households sharing a dwelling by the number of people
Dwellings according to the number of household spaces and the number of rooms
Private households by size, rooms occupied, sharing of dwellings
Take a look at the 1961 Census form to see how the questions were worded.
The original technology
In case you wondered, the 1961 data was processed using an IBM 705 computer owned by Royal Army Pay Corps. The original machine still exists and is on display at IBM UKs headquarters at Hursley Park, near Winchester
Who we are
We are a team based at the Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis (PRImA) research lab, University of Salford. We have received funding from the Office for National Statistics. We are all interested in data, and keen to make the 1961 Census aggregate data open to all. Take a look at the PRImA 1961 Census project page.
Why help?
You’ll be helping to bring the 1961 data back to life, which allows anyone to see the results easily. We will make the resulting dataset open access.

185;Space Warps - HSC;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/aprajita/space-warps-hsc/about/research;"Gravitational Lensing
Einstein's theory of gravity, General Relativity, made a remarkable prediction. Massive objects, such as stars, would bend the space around them such that passing light rays follow curved paths. Evidence for this revolutionary theory was first obtained by Arthur Eddington in 1919, when during a solar eclipse he observed that stars near the edge of the Sun appeared to be slightly out of position. The Sun was behaving like the lens in a magnifying glass and bending the light from the background stars!
In 1937, Fritz Zwicky realized that massive galaxies (which can contain anywhere from ten million to a hundred trillion stars) or clusters of galaxies could be used to magnify distant galaxies that conventional telescopes couldn't detect. As you can see, not unlike a conventional magnifying glass, these gravitational lenses not only magnify and focus the light of the distant background galaxies but they can, and mostly do, distort them as well.
When one of these gravitational lenses happens to sit right in front of a background galaxy, the magnification factor can be up to x10 or even more, giving us a zoomed-in view of the distant universe, just at that particular point. Lenses can help us investigate young galaxies more than halfway across the universe, as they formed stars and started to take on the familiar shapes we see nearby.
Observations of the distorted background galaxy can also give us useful information about the object that is behaving as a gravitational lens. The separation and distortion of the lensed images can tell astronomers how much mass there is in the object, and how it is arranged. It is one of the few ways we have of mapping out where the dark matter in the universe is, how clumpy it is and how dense it is near the centers of galaxies. Knowing this can provide crucial information about how galaxies evolve.
See the following lensing animations showcasing the lensed image configurations that can usually form.

Left: A distant background galaxy moves across a massive elliptical galaxy in the foreground
Center: A distant background quasar moves across a massive elliptical galaxy in the foreground
Right: A distant background galaxy moves across across a galaxy group in the foreground. The configuration of the lensed images can be very different based on how the multiple galaxies are arranged in the galaxy group.
The speeds of the background galaxies/quasars are too slow for us to see the changing image configurations in our lifetime. In reality, we only see a single static configuration.
Needles in a Haystack
There is a lot of interesting science to be done with gravitational lenses, from precisely weighing galaxies to measuring the expansion rate of the Universe. The problem is that they are very rare. Only about one in a thousand massive galaxies is aligned with a background object well enough to cause it to appear multiply-imaged. We currently know of about 700 objects that are behaving as gravitational lenses, largely because we have become very good at observing the night sky! Modern optical surveys cover thousands of square degrees, with images sharp and deep enough to resolve about 1 lens per square degree. There should be thousands of lenses that we can detect, but we will need to look at millions of galaxy images to find them!
The ideal solution would be to get a computer to look through all of the images, but unfortunately this is not a straightforward solution. Teaching a computer to recognize the effects of gravitational lensing is not too difficult, but they can be easily confused by galaxies that look very similar to a distorted background galaxy. Also, in order for the computer to run fast enough to analyse lots of images quickly, they have to cut a lot of corners, and this makes them less effective.
Human beings have a remarkable ability to recognise patterns and detect the unusual with only minimal training. With a basic understanding of what the distorted images of galaxies that have passed through a gravitational lens look like, participants in the SpaceWarps project can help discover new examples of this amazing phenomenon, and enable our survey scientists to carry out new investigations of stars and dark matter in the Universe.
A mostly untapped source of lenses: The Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey
The Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC), a camera mounted on the Subaru Telescope on Mauna Kea, is currently surveying a large area of the sky with excellent image quality and great depth, ideal conditions for detecting gravitational lenses. Only a fraction of the available data from HSC has been searched for lenses, using far from perfect automatic algorithms. We estimate that the images of hundreds of lenses are lying in the data, still waiting to be found!
We will be showing images centered around galaxies that are massive enough to potentially act as gravitational lenses. The task will then be to assess whether or not they actually are!
This is a tricky mission: nature is very creative, and there are galaxies of all shapes and colors out there, many of which can mimic the features of a genuine gravitational lens. You can learn more about them under Education.
The challenge is to come up with the most plausible explanation for what is going on, in collaboration with the rest of the SpaceWarps community. Do you think you can spot outer space being warped?"
186;Amazo'N'Oil;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/marcartro/amazonoil/about/research;"Oil activity puts the Peruvian Amazon on the ropes!
Oil and gas extraction activities in tropical rainforests have generated multiple and large negative environmental and health impacts. In the tropical rainforests, oil concessions do not only overlap with the most biodiverse regions of the planet, but they also cover the ancestral territories of indigenous people, who rely on them to hunt, fish and obtain water. One of the oldest oil concessions in the tropical rainforests is located in a remote region of the northern Peruvian Amazon. For almost 50 years, Achuar, Quechua, Kitchwa and Kukama indigenous people inhabiting the area have tried to protect their territories from the oil impacts.
Over the last decade, the indigenous organizations FEDIQUEP, FECONACOR, OPIKAFPE and ACODECOSPAT, have worked in close collaboration with some scientists to identify all the negative effects of oil activities in the environment and their health. Recently, they have made an alarming discovery: wild animals are ingesting oil from the recurrent oil spills.
What are we doing about it?
According to the Peruvian Ministry of Health, 98.6% and 66.2% of indigenous children of the area exceeded the acceptable limits for cadmium and lead in blood, as well as 99.2% and 79.2% of adults (DIGESA 2006). Despite the evidence that the population living in the area is exposed to high levels of contamination, no studies have been conducted to identify the exposure routes to these contaminants. Consumption of wild animals from the area has been suggested as a potential source of exposure by the local indigenous populations, which have repeatedly reported that many wildlife species ingest soil and water in places affected by oil spills. To understand better this animal behaviour, we installed 18 camera traps in apparently oil-polluted sites. We are also analysing the tissues of some animals locally hunted and the pollutants found in these locations to see whether animals actually bioaccumulate heavy metals and hydrocarbons in their bodies.
Collaborate with us to defend their territory
Do you want to support to know what is going on in the Amazon? We need you!
During one year we have been recording animal behaviour with the 18 camera-traps. This has generated a huge amount of videos, but there is not an automatic processing routine that allows us to identify which animals are visiting oil-polluted sites and what is their behaviour in these sites. We need you to help us scan the videos and identify which animal species visit oil-polluted sites and what is their activity while in these sites.
There are also many other ways that you can get involved. Follow the indigenous organizations at: http://observatoriopetrolero.org/
The achievements accomplished will not be in vain!
Results from this project will be very useful for the scientific community, as animal oil-ingestion is a phenomenon that has never been studied before. Results will also be very useful for the inhabitants of the region, who are fighting to protect their land and health. Moreover, considering that oil activities take place worldwide, results will provide a very valuable knowledge of the health and environmental impacts of the oil industry in the Amazon and beyond.
Through this project we also expect to have an impact on education and to raise awareness about a critical issue that the Amazon and its inhabitants face nowadays.

Young forests are the vibrant and diverse result of natural succession. Full of the energy of youth, they are characterized by dense vegetation including young trees and abundant shrubs. Over 100 species rely on young forests in the northeastern region of the United States. Unfortunately, as a result of human influences these forests are becoming increasingly rare and fragmented, resulting in declines of many animal species. In response to these declines, an unprecedented collaborative effort to create and improve young forest is underway. However, identifying the best methods to create high quality young forest for a diverse array of species has presented challenges to biologists and land managers.
Scientists interested in these challenges and in improving methods for creating and enhancing young forest to benefit wildlife began a camera trapping study in 2014 to monitor wildlife diversity and distributions within the forests of the Hudson Valley, NY. Our team continues to use camera traps to answer these questions to this day. To learn more about recovering young forests visit https://youngforest.org/.
An Opportunity for Young Scientists
In 2017, a team of researchers and exceptional students from the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry recognized the need for identifying and cataloging the data from this effort and helped to create Canid Camera. These students now gain research experience and experience in communicating science to public audiences by helping to maintain Canid Camera, creating and releasing newsletters and materials, monitoring discussion forums, and helping identify wildlife in photos.
The Science
Wildlife Diversity

Where are different species most frequently found within forests? Which forest types have the highest wildlife diversity in New York? Which forest management practices are most beneficial to particular species? These are the kinds of questions we are seeking to answer with the data collected from Canid Camera. We hope results from this study will inform forest management and to improve forest health habitat quality for wildlife.
New England cottontail

The New England cottontail is our only native cottontail in North America east of the Hudson River. Exclusive to dense cover, such as that provided by young forests, the New England cottontail has declined precipitously with declines in young forest and is at risk of disappearing from our planet. Efforts to recover the New England cottontail are underway and are headed by efforts to create young forest. However, we still do not know how factors such as competition with deer for high quality food or common predators like the coyote, a recent arrival to the Northeast, may affect the recovery of New England cottontail. We are using data from Canid Camera to examine how these wildlife species interact, so that we can better manage forests to help the cottontail.

eMammal is a system for collecting, storing, and sharing camera trap data, run in conjunction by the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute and the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. The system is designed for scientists and citizen scientists, and anyone who wants to join in the fun and discovery of camera trapping. Professional and volunteer camera trappers use our software to look at pictures, identify animals, and upload them to the Smithsonian Data Repository for review and storage. These data are useful for addressing important scientific and conservation questions, and the pictures provide a unique view into the hidden world of wildlife.
Though we have our own volunteers who upload these pictures and tag them, the experts manage several volunteers for each project and often end up with many more images to look over. This is where Zooniverse comes in - with YOUR help, we can ease the burden on the experts for animal identification. After all, if 20 people agree that a sequence of images is a deer, it's probably a deer.
eMammal photos and data, depending on the project, are either immediately available after expert review, or only available after a three-year embargo. The latter occurs when the expert would like to publish their findings before revealing their data for public download. All eMammal project data is intended for public consumption.

This crowd-sourcing transcription project is a collaboration between historians, social scientists and the African American Civil War Museum. Our goals are to improve our knowledge of the African Americans who fought for freedom in the American Civil War, to provide descendants of the soldiers with access to information on their ancestors, and to present students of history with primary documents from a pivotal moment in African American history. To do this we are building a comprehensive database of the estimated 200,000 soldiers who formed the United States Colored Troops (USCT) (see FAQ for more info on the USCT).
We are transcribing images of the soldiers' military service records, which have been photographed and scanned by the National Archives and Records Administration and Fold 3. From these we are collecting detailed individual information such as name, age, height, place of birth and enlistment, as well as evidence of battles fought, injuries and casualties sustained, and honors and promotions won. Our interface allows users to highlight such evidence, bringing it to the attention of scholars and the public.
The completed database will be presented on the website of the African American Civil War Museum. This website will allow teachers and students to explore African American history, by presenting them with interactive maps and a searchable database of all the soldiers. The database will help users to identify ancestors who fought in the Civil War. It will also allow scholars to follow the lives of African American veterans after the war, matching individual soldiers to military pension files and census records, following the great example of the Union Army Data project. In this way we hope to trace the broader impact of African American service on the post-war social, political, and racial order.

190;Grouse Grooves;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/etymstra/grouse-grooves/about/research;"Greater Sage-grouse Conservation and Behavior
Greater Sage-grouse: Umbrella species of the Western United States
Greater sage-grouse are an important member of the fragile sage steppe ecosystem. Conservation of this species in sagebrush areas lends itself to the conservation of 350+ other species that share this habitat (including pronghorn, sage thrashers, and pygmy rabbits), thus earning the greater sage-grouse the label ""umbrella species"". The greater sage-grouse is a sage-brush obligate species, meaning that it depends on sagebrush for its diet, breeding locations (leks) and nesting habitat.
Our camera trap project will collect data on what times males attend leks, the areas on which males display in order to attract females. Females will mate with males here and then nest nearby. Understanding how the birds use leks will give scientists and conservation managers from agencies such as the Bureau for Land Management, a better idea of a) how many males are present on the lek throughout the season, b) what times of the season have the highest attendance, and c) what times of day have the highest attendance.
Camera Trap Research
We are using camera traps to monitor and collect data in California's Eastern Sierra. Cameras are deployed on grouse leks. The grouse in this area are part of the genetically distinct Bi-State Population. By monitoring the birds on their lekking grounds, we will collect information about what areas the birds use and when they use them. Previous studies (including those from our own research group, see Results tab) with similar methods have shown that the birds do not just occupy the lek during peak display hours (around dawn), but rather may return throughout the day and even throughout the night. This behavior may be important in conservation efforts as it gives managers a better idea of the greater sage-grouse's needs during a critical period of their life history. Further, the data collected from this project may serve as a jumping off point for more questions regarding lek breeding behaviors not only in sage-grouse but many other species with similar breeding strategies.
Community and Citizen Science in the Eastern Sierra
Our camera traps also play a role in a citizen science project involving community members in the Eastern Sierra, primarily high school students. Students are responsible for deploying cameras and using Zooniverse to classify data.
In the winter and spring of 2017, we started this project in the Long Valley area working with students from the surrounding area. The project was used as a case study for researchers from UC Davis's Youth-focused Community and Citizen Science program
This project aims to allow students to gain environmental science agency. In the spring of 2017, we started this project in Long Valley.
Students have also joined graduate student researchers in the field. In the next year, students will also be able to conduct their own research projects alongside graduate student researchers and agency wildlife biologists. Stay tuned for more updates!
More Grouse Research in the Patricelli Lab
Biomarkers of sage-grouse health and habitat, performance on the lek and landscape level conservation
Eric Tymstra, PhD candidate and the lead researcher on the camera trap project, is investigating the role of dietary quality on male performance on the lek. He observes males on the lek every day during the field season and then collects fecal (poop!) and vegetation samples to compare dietary quality and stress hormones to on-lek performance. This work is being done in collaboration with Professor Jennifer Forbey from Boise State University, and her graduate student Chelsea Merriman, as well as Dr. Peter Coates from the U.S. Geological Survey and his research group.
This will provide Eric, and conservation managers, with data on how sagebrush quality affects population dynamics of sage-grouse.
Impact of Noise on Sage-grouse
Sage-grouse habitat overlaps extensively with land used by humans for energy, agriculture and settlement. As such, sage-grouse are increasingly exposed to anthropogenic noise (noise pollution). Sage-grouse, and many other species, rely on acoustic communication to court mates and thus may be particularly vulnerable to noise pollution. The Patricelli lab, with former graduate student Dr. Jessica Blickley, investigated the effects of noise from energy-development on sage-grouse breeding behaviors. The lab found a decline in male attendance on leks exposed to experimental energy-development noise, as well as evidence of increased stress and altered behaviors. To read more about noise effects on sage-grouse and other species, visit the lab's website.
Attack of the Fembots: Social Landscapes and Mate Choice
The Patricelli Lab at UC Davis is involved in animal behavior research. In winter and spring, Professor Patricelli and research scientist Dr. Alan Krakauer, along with UC Davis graduate students, travel to the field to study the mating behaviors of greater sage-grouse. Dr. Patricelli is known for using ""fembots"" in her research. These robots, made from taxidermied females that died from vehicle strikes or natural causes, allow researchers to manipulate the social environment that birds experience. Alan Krakauer has played a critical role in all the research in the lab, including investigations of sound production mechanisms and ""handedness"" in male displays. Dr. Anna Perry, who recently finished her PhD in the lab, used fembots to manipulate male social stimulus and measured male responses. Ryane Logsdon, a current PhD student in the lab, has used the fembots to investigate the role of the physical structure of the lek in the social environment of the lek.

191;Orangutan Nest Watch;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/sol-dot-milne/orangutan-nest-watch/about/research;"Changing land use is threatening Orangutans in their only habitats, on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra. We need to understand more about their habitat in order to start making land use decisions that will maximise the chances of survival of this already endangered species.
Our research is based in Sabah, Malaysia, in the north of Borneo.
In the North of the vitally important Heart of Borneo region www.heartofborneo.org/
This is one of the most beautiful places in the world, and one of the world's major biodiversity hotspots.
It is also, however a highly human- modified landscape, with oil palm agriculture and logging responsible for the loss of approximately 70% of the forest.
However the Sabah Government has recently made a landmark deal and committed to protecting 30% of state's forest, leading by example, creating protected forest reserves in which wildlife may find refuge.
In order to allocate these protected areas efficiently, it is important to understand where ecologically important umbrella species (species whose habitat requirements encompass those of a huge range of wildlife) live and how their numbers vary across a range of forest types, from pristine primary forest to severely degraded secondary forest. We are focusing on orangutans due to their selective habitat requirements and the ability to survey for this species over large areas.
We are also focusing on Strangler Fig Trees (Ficus spp.) due to their importance as a food source to a huge number of mammals and birds, a favourite of Orangutans. There is a direct, positive correlation between the number of Strangler Fig Trees and the density of Orangutans.
These trees are also very identifiable from the air, and therefore a key focus of our study.
Traditionally, surveys of orangutan nests have been done on foot, walking many kilometres through dense forest in order to collect this data. Orangutans are highly intelligent, and are therefore very selective about where they choose to make their nests.

However this kind of work can be time consuming when we need to survey large areas.
We need to go by truck to survey in remote locations but flooding frequently destroys bridges that connect large tracts of forest.
Or roads can break and swallow cars completely!
Even when the roads are in good working order, traffic can still get pretty heavy.
-and the field research team was getting fed up with running into beehives during surveys! They don't like to be disturbed.
Even Cody, our data dog was getting tired of walking such long distances through forest day after day.
Under the wing of Keeyen Pang at HornbillSurveys.com we looked into the use of drones for this survey.
Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs or drones) we can take high resolution images of the forest canopy in order to understand what kind of forest orangutans prefer and count the number of nests in order to determine the local density of orangutans in different forest types.
We scan through these images to find orangutan nests, which we can use to determine the density of the population in the area.
However every time we do a survey flight, we get hundreds of pictures that need to be searched through carefully in order to find these nests, which is why your help is vital.
With every click, you are contributing valuable data to our project, which will enable us to estimate the local population abundance of orangutans across a wide variety of habitat types, which will deepen our understanding of how we can protect this species."
192;Numbat Discovery;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/amyrobey996/numbat-discovery/about/research;"Understanding and protecting Australia’s iconic marsupial
The numbat (Myrmecobius fasciatus) is an iconic, Australian endemic marsupial. Prior to European settlement, the numbat once populated much of southern semi-arid and arid Australia, extending from the west coast to northwest Victoria and western New South Wales. By the 1970s, numbats had disappeared from most of their range (99%), surviving only in small areas of southwest Australia. Sadly, this means they’re now considered endangered.
Widespread clearing of prime numbat habitat and predation by feral predators have been the main drivers of their decline.
The Upper Warren region in south Western Australia supports the largest remaining population of endangered numbats and is one of only two natural populations remaining in the world. While we believe there may be less than 1,000 animals alive today, having a more accurate population count, and determining their distribution and addressing why they are declining, is critical to their future survival.
The species is listed as endangered under The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, as endangered under the Australian Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, and as ‘endangered fauna that is rare or is likely to become extinct’ under the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 (WA).
The research project
""Numbat Discovery"" is part of a joint PhD project with Murdoch University and the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions. It aims to improve the understanding of the numbat population in the Upper Warren Region to inform management for the conservation and recovery of the species. The objectives are to develop robust survey methods to define the range, estimate population density and abundance and monitor population trends of the Upper Warren numbat population.
This PhD project takes a multi-stage adaptive approach, where initial results will inform final survey design. Stage two will implement survey methods developed during the first stage to determine the numbat’s range within the Upper Warren Region, and to estimate numbat density and absolute abundance. Finally a long-term monitoring program will be established that will assist in understanding if management actions are effective and numbats are on the increase. The project also aims to vastly improve our understanding of the many other animals sharing the same forests and woodlands.
This project is part of a larger initiative, the South West Threatened Fauna Recovery Project: Southern Jarrah Forest, which is being led by the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions with support from the Australian Government’s National Landcare Program.
Numbat Discovery - How you can help
Fifty independent camera-traps have been installed along each of three transects (i.e. a total of 150kms). Once triggered by movement, the cameras take 10 images in a row. This gives us the best opportunity to see the animal (and importantly numbat stripes to potentially distinguish individuals!). It also means that we have a lot of photos to process! Zooniverse users help us to make sense of all the photos by classifying the type and number of animals in each photo. The Upper Warren Region in which these surveys are being done is extremely important for the conservation of many other Australian native species too, including several threatened mammals such as the woylie, western ringtail possum and chuditch. From western pygmy possums and mardo to phascogales and numbats, see what wildlife you can spot living in the Upper Warren Region!

193;Interior Least Tern and Piping Plover Predators;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/kaley13/interior-least-tern-and-piping-plover-predators/about/research;"Project Background
The endangered interior least tern (Sternula antillarum athalassos) and threatened piping plover (Charadrius melodus) migrate to the Central Platte River Basin in Nebraska, during late April to mid-August to nest on exposed river islands and off-channel habitat (sand and gravel mines) along the Platte River. The Platte River Recovery Implementation Program (PRRIP) and its partners have constructed and manage approximately 60 hectares (150 acres) of off-channel nesting habitat that is protected and monitored for interior least tern and piping plover productivity annually.

Prevention of predation by terrestrial and avian predators are important objectives for increasing productivity of interior least terns and piping plovers. As such, potential predator perches near the nesting areas are removed and permanent electrified fences are placed across the entrance to each nesting area that otherwise is moated by water. Non-electrified fence panels are positioned on the ends of the permanent fence and extend 2–3 meters into the water. However, predation is still a factor for reducing productivity within these managed off-channel nesting sites. Identifying predation events and the species responsible are truly difficult to determine if the event is not seen firsthand and no sign of predation (i.e., tracks in the sand, etc.) is left behind.
Purpose
The purpose of our study is to investigate predator presence, composition and abundance and to document possible predation events at interior least tern and piping plover off-channel nesting sites with the use of remote cameras. Remote cameras have been deployed at nesting sites and are programmed to collect an image every 5 minutes and when triggered by predator activity. For each image, we aim to identify species presence, abundance, and activity. Results from our study will help to identify possible management strategies that could be implemented to further reduce predation at off-channel nesting sites and increase productivity of these threatened and endangered species.

A total of 36 cameras are deployed during the nesting season of interior least tern and piping plover and are programmed to collect an image every 5 minutes and when triggered by predator activity. We will have over 2.5 million photos to review this year and only a few researchers to complete this daunting task. We would love for you to join our team and help evaluate these photographs to identify any predator activity you find in them. Your assistance will make a huge difference in the success of this project! We will use the results of our study to better understand predator communities at off-channel nesting sites and will use this information to further reduce predation events in the future.

Our research group focuses on two areas: first, using 3D image data to answer interesting biological questions; and second, developing novel software to reduce the difficulty of analyzing the 3D image data we're interested in. Most of our team is from Diamond Light Source, the UK's national synchrotron. As our research incorporates different scientific disciplines, the background of our team is split between biology, imaging, and computer science.
We work with many different types of 3D imaging data. Right now, we're working with data from a technique called Cryo soft X-ray tomography (see below for more information) to answer questions about how organelles inside the cells may change in Huntington disease.

Aerial view of Diamond Light Source on the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus in South Oxfordshire, UK.
What are we studying?
Protein Misfolding Disorders
Protein misfolding disorders are a class of diseases associated with unchecked protein misfolding and aggregation. Some examples we are focusing on are Huntington's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease. In each case, a protein or a protein fragment takes a nonstandard structure due to a genetic mutation or abnormal cellular processing. It's common that the nonstandard structure is prone to self-aggregation, or clumping together. By aggregating, the normal cellular function of the protein is lost and sometimes, the aggregated form can take on a new cellular function or interactions. In these ways, the structural changes at the protein level lead to structural changes at the cellular level and finally to the manifestations of the disease.
Huntington's Disease Overview
Huntington's Disease mainly affects the brain and gets worse over time. It's caused by a genetic mutation in the Huntington gene. Early symptoms of the disease are subtle mood changes and cognitive difficulties. These are usually followed by a lack of coordination and unsteady gait which can then progress to uncoordinated, jerky body movements and cognitive decline. In the brain, Huntington's Disease is characterized by loss of a specific type of neuron (striatal) and a progressive pattern of brain atrophy. Currently, diagnosis of Huntington's is through psychiatric examinations, neuroimaging and a genetic test. However, since no treatment or cure currently exists, and the knowledge can affect many people in a family because of the genetic nature of the mutation, many patients choose not to be tested early in life.
At the molecular level, the mutation occurs in a specific stretch of the Huntington gene. The mutation is an expansion; extra DNA bases are added in where they shouldn't be which leads to extra amino acids in the protein once it's been translated. These extra amino acids lead to atypical processing of the protein, creating a small fragment that includes the expanded area. This fragment is what then aggregates leading to the disease. Localisation studies have shown that this fragment can be found both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of brain cells. And that mitochondrial function is lowered in Huntington's Disease.
We are testing the hypothesis that the presence of Huntington aggregates leads to structural changes in the cell - perhaps through reorganisation of the structures already present, an increase or decrease in the number of a specific type of structure, or changes in size and shape of a structure. To answer this biology question, we use a technique called Cryo soft X-ray Tomography (see below for more information) that can capture the detailed structure of intracellular components. Below is the image of a Huntington cell under Cryo soft X-ray Tomography, showing the nucleus (N) and cytoplasm (C) that consists of numerous organelles.
Cryo Soft X-ray Tomography
Cryo Soft X-ray Tomography (cryoSXT) is a technique that bridges the gap between light microscopy and electron microscopy. This means we can image whole cells with good contrast giving us the ability to visualize cellular compartments, organelles and some cytoskeletal elements. All of this is done at very cold temperatures and without chemically fixing or staining the cells to achieve contrast. However, this technique only provides a limited resolution, which means we cannot see individual proteins or protein complexes.

Soft X-ray Microscope at Diamond Light Source.
Workflow Overview
In our previous workflow on this project (https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/msbrhonclif/science-scribbler), the citizen scientists have helped annotate the organelles inside the cell. Annotation is the process of labelling and representing objects (organelles) in the imaging data. It is a complicated and difficult task since there are different types of organelles with various intensities, sizes and shapes. In addition, differentiating the subcellular structure (organelle) from the background (non-organelle) is particularly difficult in gray scale images due to a low signal-to-noise ratio. Because of this, there is a lot of variabilty and subjectivity in the original annotation data we collected. Before analysing this data, we would like to clean it up so that we can answer the biological questions more accurately and correctly.
This is where we need your help! In order to overcome the variability associated with the original annotations, we need your help to ensure a consensus emerges!"
195;Snapshot Grumeti;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/meredithspalmer/snapshot-grumeti/about/research;"Our History
The Serengeti plains teem with wildlife, including vast herds of plains game, a plethora of predators and the spectacle of the annual wildebeest migration. The Grumeti Fund and Singita are the proud custodians of 350,000 acres of this unique ecosystem. Located in the western corridor of the Serengeti ecosystem, a region considered by many to be an international treasure, the Singita Grumeti concessions are bountiful lands, rich in flora and fauna.
But they weren’t always this way. By the turn of the 21st century, a combination of uncontrolled illegal hunting, rampant wildlife, and spreading stands of invasive alien vegetation had severely depressed resident wildlife numbers.
Thankfully, in 2002, American philanthropist Paul Tudor Jones made it his personal quest to rehabilitate and restore the Grumeti concessions to their former glory. He established the non-profit Grumeti Fund to begin the mammoth task of rehabilitating the degraded area, and shortly afterwards partnered with the world-renowned Singita safari brand to strengthen and continue this mission.
This far-sighted partnership, combined with holistic adaptive management approach and law enforcement strategy, has helped animal populations rebound dramatically, turning Grumeti into the ultimate conservation success story and one of the most sought-after photographic safari destinations on the continent. The result is a magnificent wilderness experience that captivates guests, supports the ongoing conservation work, and empowers communities.
Our joint mission is to contribute to the conservation of the Serengeti ecosystem, its natural landscape, and its wildlife through partnerships with local communities and other stakeholders to create a world in which people and wildlife live together, sustainably, forever.
Conservation Challenges

Alien Plants
Invasive plants are species that do not occur naturally in an area – they have been introduced, usually by humans, either intentionally or by mistake. As they generally have no natural enemies in their new homes, these invaders are able to outcompete native species and quickly take over large swathes of land. The resultant thickets are often almost impenetrable and inedible for indigenous mammals, meaning that the entire area is lost to indigenous fauna and flora alike. The Grumeti Fund employs comprehensive invasive species control programs within the concessions and in nearby villages with the aim of eradicating and / or preventing the spread of siam weed, prickly pear, feverfew, and Mexican sunflower.
Human-Wildlife Conflict
Conflict between people and wildlife is a major threat to the conservation of wildlife globally, and the western Serengeti is no exception. Wildlife can damage crops, livestock, and structures, and injure or kill people, and is known to undermine the willingness of local communities to support conservation efforts. The Grumeti Fund is currently working on multiple projects aimed at better understanding where, when, and why conflict is likely to develop, and has invested in a mobile mitigation unit to prevent and respond to incidents.
Illegal Resource Extraction
The illegal extraction of resources within protected areas occurs globally. In the western Serengeti, people poach for bushmeat, graze cattle, and cut down trees for charcoal within reserve boundaries. Effective law enforcement is a key component of a holistic management programme, and the Grumeti Fund combines cutting-edge technology and boots on the ground to combat poaching and other forms of illegal resource extraction.
Key Projects
Camera Trapping
As part of the Snapshot program, we installed 316 cameras across the 350,000-acre concession. These images will primarily be used to monitor wildlife population movements and densities, and will become part of a long-term data set. The Grumeti Fund’s aim for this project is to support management decisions and address broader research questions related to human-wildlife interactions. The camera traps will provide information on where and when wildlife occur throughout the reserve, and how movements relate to proximity to protected area edges and areas inhabited by people. This will allow the Grumeti Fund to be more proactive in prioritizing habitat areas and species for management within the reserve, and in developing mitigation solutions and supporting local communities along the boundary that experience conflict with elephant, lion, and hyena, with the ultimate aim of safeguarding the western Serengeti for both people and wildlife.
Elephant Collaring
In 2018, the Grumeti Fund fit 30 elephants with GPS collars in order to better understand their movements throughout the Grumeti concessions, adjacent communities, and the Serengeti ecosystem. This near real time information on elephant movements is being used to improve the capacity of the Grumeti Fund and local partners to prevent crop losses and to protect both elephants and people.
Endangered Species Reintroductions
Part of the commitment of the Grumeti Fund is the re-establishment of species that, through human pressure, have become locally extinct in the area in the past. The Grumeti Fund has been instrumental in the funding, translocating, and reintroduction of a number of endangered and locally extinct species to Grumeti and the wider Serengeti ecosystem. Priorities include the reintroductions of black rhino, African wild dog, and greater Kudu. Late 2018 saw the translocation of a male black rhino from the San Diego Zoo to Grumeti, and 2019 is looking to be an exciting year with plans for the reintroduction of 10 more black rhino.

196;Snapshot Gondwana;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/meredithspalmer/snapshot-gondwana/about/research;"Gondwana Game Reserve
Gondwana Game Reserves is situation within a region of globably unique floral and faunal diversity. The Gondwana Conservation Foundation (GCF) acts to foster and preserve this amazing ecosystem.
Endangered Wildlife
One of the primary goals of the GCF is on the relocation and long term sustainability of desert black rhino, white rhino, cheetah, bontebok, and Cape mountain zebra through the provision of habitat and prey species, detailed monitoring, research, and anti-poaching training and implementation. Through a focus on scientific research, protection, and population growth, Gondwanda aims to establish sustainable core populations of these endangered and threatened species that can contribute to new populations in reserves throughout the Western Cape.
Herds of wildlife including eland, giraffe, hippo, cheetah and zebra can be seen all across this majestic landscape. Over 20 species of wildlife including mountain zebra, hippo, cheetah, kudu, eland, elephant, hartebeest, lion, giraffe, and black rhinoceros have been reintroduced to Gondwana through the extensive rewildling efforts of the Gondwana Conservation Fund. Gondwana is home to the first wild lion cubs and elephant calves born in the Southern Cape in the last 150 years, and contains breeding pairs of Black Harriers when there are only 1000 left worldwide. There are several on-going wildlife research programs at Gondwana, including Cape Leopard and elephant monitoring studies. Cape leopards are a rare subspecies of leopard that are physically smaller than their savanna cousins. Gondwana's Cape Leopard monitoring project utilizes our camera traps to try to identify the number and sex ratios of the leopard population in the area. There are estimated to be only 35 leopards left in the Garden Route, likely from only one gene pool. It is believed that there are approximately 350 leopard left in the Western and Eastern Capes combined. Gondwana also studies their elephants using GPS collars which provide important and new information about how these giant herbivores utilize and impact the fynbos vegetation.
Endangered Vegetation
The southern cape of South Africa is home to one of the most critically endangered vegetation types on earth - the fynbos. The Gondwana Conservation Foundation focuses on the rehabilitation and promotion of biodiversity for all ecosystems within the Cape Floristic Kingdom. The Cape Floristic Kingdom is the smallest and most criticially endangered of all the floristic kingdoms. These critically endangered vegetation types ad wetlands are under severe pressure with the invasive of alien vegetation.
Gondwana is situated within the Cape Floristic Kingdom, a world-renowned biodiversity hotspot. It is the smallest Floral Kingdom in the world yet the most diverse in terms of plant species and is endemic to South Africa. The Cape Floristic Kingdom comprises less than 0.04% of the earth’s land surface, yet harbors 3-4% of the worlds’ species. As a comparison, all of tropical Africa contains some 30,000 plant species in almost 20 million square kilometers. This is only 3.5 times more species than those found in the Fynbos biome, but in an area 235 times as large! Almost three-quarters of all the species in South Africa’s IUCN Red Data book of threatened or endangered species are currently growing in the Cape Floral Kingdom, which means that hundreds of species are facing extinction. Gondwana is the largest privately owned piece of land situated within the Cape Floristic Kingdom
The dominant biome within the Cape Floristic Kingdom is the Fynbos Biome. The Fynbos covers only about 6.7% of South Africa (about 85 000 km2) but has the largest number of plant species of any biome in the country (about 7500). The intrinsic value of conserving this unique Biome is undoubtedly its high levels of biodiversity and endemism. 80% of Gondwana’s vegetation is made of the Fynbos Biome. Gondwana has the opportunity to join in the progression of the world-renowned Eden to Addo Corridor. Gondwana would be the largest privately owned piece of land the has the endangered Fynbos as a predominant species within the corridor. Gondwana is currently under huge threat from the invasion of alien plant species with particular reference to Acacia Mimosa – Black wattle, Acacia cyclops – port Jackson and Hakea. Alien vegetation causes a rapid decrease in botanical diversity and water runoff and seepage which negatively impacts on wetlands. Gondwana has an ongoing alien removal management plan where budgets and resource allow with the focus on reducing spread and the eradication of single standing mature trees. This is an area of great focus for Gondwana going forward to sustainably remove the alien vegetation which occupies 5% of the total reserve.

197;Snapshot APNR;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/shuebner729/snapshot-apnr/about/research;"The Associated Private Nature Reserves (APNR) in South Africa is made up of five reserves: Klaserie Nature Reserve, Umbabat Game Reserve, Balule Game Reserve, Thornybush Game Reserve, and Timbavati Nature and Game Reserve. Snapshot Safari cameras have been placed on the same sites as observational transects from which data on vegetation has been collected since 1989. The combination of camera traps that tell us where the wildlife are and vegetational data taken from the transects will allow us to evaluate how trees respond to the restoration of large mammals over time.
Because each of these reserves has agreed to remove boundary fences with Kruger National Park to make more space for wildlife at different times over the past several decades, an interesting natural experiment has taken place whereby wildlife have had access to each reserve for varying lengths of time. Klaserie, Umbabat, and Timbavati removed their boundary fences with KNP in 1988, Balule in 2003, and Thornybush in 2016. We have also deployed Snapshot cameras in neighboring Kapama, which has not yet removed its fences, to serve as a control. This sequence combined with data collected at each reserve before and after removal of the fences provides an unprecedented look at the long-term effects of large mammal reintroductions on tree community composition and recruitment to heights sufficient to survive wildfires.
The APNR covers 180,000 hectares of land and supports a wide variety of conservation, research, and community development programs. These include the “Save the Elephants” project founded by Dr. Ian Douglas Hamilton, the ""The Southern Ground Hornbill Project,"" a rhino protection group, and the “Tembo” project which is dedicated to studying buffalo and hosted by the University of Wageningen.
The Klaserie Private Nature Reserve was established in 1972 and is one of the largest privately owned reserves in South Africa. The reserve is home to the Eco Children organization, which aims to increase environmental awareness and education amongst youth in the area, with the goal of generating better conservation and economic outcomes for South Africa.
The Umbabat Nature Reserve has been open since 1988, when the fences bordering the Kruger Nature Reserve were dropped. Umbabat is known for the birth of the first wild white lions born in the Timbavati area under natural circumstances. The Umbabat Reserve includes N’tsiri, Ndlopfu and Ingwelala game reserves where mopani bushveld, watering holes, and river beds attract a huge variety of wildlife.
The Balule Nature Reserve includes a number of privately owned farms that have been formed a collective to share resources and protect wildlife. Balule is home to the Black Mamba Anti-Poaching Unit, the first majority female anti-poaching unit in South Africa. Their mission is guided by the ""Broken Window"" philosophy, in which they strive to make this reserve the most difficult and least profitable place to poach any wildlife species. Balule also hosts the Bush Babies Environmental Education Program, which has reached over 2000 children thus far in their mission to teach future community leaders about the benefits of nature conservation."
198;Snapshot Mariri;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/meredithspalmer/snapshot-mariri/about/research;"Niassa Carnivore Project
The Niassa Carnivore Project is a holistic conservation program with a mission to promote coexistence among large carnivores and people in Niassa National Reserve (NNR). We have been working here for 15 years in close collaboration with the Mozambican Government, Niassa Reserve Management authority, and the local communities that live inside NNR.
Our vision is to see the Niassa Reserve grow into a conservation area where large carnivores thrive with the full participation and support of Niassa’s local people. As you look at the camera trap images, you will sometimes see people using the same paths as animals. One minute a person is collecting grass, and the next moment an elephant is using the same path. Typically these are not poachers – these are the day to day activities of the local people who live inside this extraordinary protected area. These people are an essential part of successful wildlife conservation, and this camera trap survey will help to demonstrate that. Sometimes we get people dancing in front of the camera, showing off pictures they have drawn, or taking a selfie. On rare occasions, we have inadvertently taken pictures of poachers with ivory. Niassa has lost more than 10,000 elephants to poaching since 2010.
At present, Niassa is home to 800-1000 lions, 350 wild dogs, leopards, and hyenas. 40,000 people live here, spread across more than 40 villages. Our current conservation efforts are focused on lions, leopards, spotted hyenas and African wild dogs, but we recognize that conserving these animals means protecting their prey and the habitats they depend on. Some of the most significant threats to these species – bushmeat snaring, retaliatory killing, poison, and habitat degradation/transformation - are present in the Niassa wilderness. Large carnivores function as a kind of, “thermometer,” measuring the health of the ecosystem.

S. McConnell
Our long term goals are threefold. Over the course of the next 25 years, we aim to: secure the large carnivore populations by directly reducing their threats; to provide an effective, focused, and locally derived environmental education and skills training program for the people who live inside Niassa Reserve; and to develop a model where communities can participate in conservation and be part of the solution (see our website for more details).
We are a community based initiative, and we are currently running conservation programs that combat poaching, develop community partnerships with performance payments, provide alternative livelihoods (honey, small livestock, craft and design, conservation tourism), increase food security through conservation agriculture, and implement environmental education programs(wildlife clubs, secondary school scholarships, bushvisits).
Where We Work
Niassa National Reserve (NNR) is located in northern Mozambique, with its northern boundary the Ruvuma River bordering Tanzania. Niassa National Reserve covers 42,000 km2 – an area larger than Switzerland.
NNR is recognized as the most important protected area in Mozambique, and it is of profound importance for the global conservation of African wildlife, especially for the African lion, wild dog, and elephant.
The Reserve is currently co-managed by the Ministry of Tourism (MITUR) and the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS). To assist in management, NNR is divided into 17 management concessions, with nine concessions designated for sport hunting and four currently leased for ecotourism. Biodiversity surveys have revealed a species-rich and largely intact ecosystem of miombo woodlands, rivers, inselbergs (granite “island” mountains), wetlands, and plains. More than 14,000 elephants and 13,000 Sable antelope are protected here. Niassa also supports rare birds like the Taita falcon, African skimmer, Dickinson’s kestrel and Angola pitta as well as an endemic reptile, the Mecula Girdled Lizard. Rhino are locally extinct in Niassa Reserve, and cheetah, caracal and roan antelope have not been recorded here.
Threats to Wildlife and Conservation Challenges
Increases in elephant poaching, timber logging, habitat transformation, population growth and bush meat snaring are some of the pressures on the Reserve and its species. Aerial surveys show that 10,000 elephants were killed between 2010 and 2014 in Niassa Reserve. Niassa Reserve also supports a growing human population. The future of Niassa is as much about its people as it is about the wildlife. With limited educational services available to them, and few ways to acquire marketable skills for outside employment, most families rely primarily on consumptive use of the available natural resources, particularly by fishing, gathering and selling honey, selling tobacco, trading in large cat and zebra skins, selling ivory and eating and selling bushmeat or wild meat.
Camera Trapping
Our camera trapping is currently focused in the south eastern section in two concessions: L5 South and L4 east – an area of 1500km2. SnapshotSafari will help us to analyze the data efficiently through citizen science, which will hopefully allow us to expand the grid to other areas. At the moment, we are limited by our ability to access all the cameras and process the images.
We are currently using our camera traps (motion activated cameras) to assess the effectiveness of our conservation programs. In addition, we use the pictures from cameras around villages as incentive for conservation actions but linking them to performance payments. For pictures taken of specific animals, communities earn points that are converted to money for community conservation funds. This program follows the program developed by the Ruaha Carnivore Project in Tanzania and is a Pride Conservation Alliance collaboration. We place the cameras in 2km x 2km grids, at waterholes, and around villages inside the protected area. Sometimes we get amazing pictures that we don’t expect, like the images below:

199;Snapshot Ruaha;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/meredithspalmer/snapshot-ruaha/about/research;"The Ruaha Carnivore Project
The mission of the Ruaha Carnivore Project is to achieve successful human-carnivore coexistence by empowering local communities, and to develop effective strategies for long-term carnivore conservation.
We aim to reduce the costs and improve the benefits associated with wildlife, particularly carnivores, on village land and directly engage and empower local people in conservation. We are also collecting the first detailed data on large carnivore conservation in this landscape, as this has been highlighted as a priority in regional and national carnivore conservation action plans. Our ecological research has led to the first scientific data and publications on Ruaha's carnivore populations, and has provided vital information for future conservation planning.
We have developed an innovative model of community camera trapping, where local villagers are trained and employed in wildlife monitoring, and villages that demonstrate the presence of more wildlife receive significant additional benefits. The villagers have the power to control how they manage their wildlife, so by taking actions - whether protecting habitat, reducing poisoning or removing snares - they can improve the status of their wildlife populations and substantially increase the benefits received by their village, with wide-ranging benefits for both people and wildlife.
We have significantly reduced human-carnivore conflict in the core study area - carnivore killing in the core area has reduced by over 80% since 2011. However, given the size of this landscape and its importance for both Tanzanian and global conservation, there is an urgent need to continue and expand our work. We have developed very promising conflict mitigation, ecological and community conservation approaches, and we will continue and expand these innovative approaches at a wider scale in Ruaha, elsewhere in Africa and beyond to generate meaningful benefits for both people and wildlife.
Ruaha National Park
The Ruaha landscape, at around 50,000 km2, is one of the most important wildlife areas left in Africa. At the heart of the Ruaha landscape is the 20,226 km2 Ruaha National Park, the largest National Park in East Africa and the second largest in Africa. The greater Ruaha landscape also includes multiple Game Reserves, as well as Wildlife Management Areas and village land. As with other parks in Tanzania, Ruaha National Park is not fenced, which is one of the reasons the wider landscape is so valuable for wildlife. Since wildlife can roam freely across the landscape, however, this often leads to significant conflict with local people beyond the protected area edges.
Ruaha forms important habitat for large carnivores, especially in the wet season. This landscape is also important for pastoralists because it forms a movement corridor linking this pastoralist rangeland with those to the north-east, north-west, and south-west. It also has very high rates of human-wildlife conflict, including the killing of humans by wildlife. Such killings could lead to wider negative impacts across this landscape. The dominant ethnic group in the region is the Hehe, who are traditionally agriculturalists, but various pastoralist groups have moved into the area over recent decades, including the Maasi, Sukuma, and Barabaig.
Ruaha is at the intersection of the Eastern African and Southern African eco-regions, making it a biodiversity hotspot. It is one of the few parks where you can see both the greater and the lesser kudu. It supports over 570 bird species, including some endemic species such as the Tanzanian red-billed hornbill. The area is one of outstanding biodiversity and species endemism, is situated within one of the World Wide Fund for Nature's 'Global 200' ecoregions, and has been named by the EU as a Key Landscape for Conservation.
The greater Ruaha landscape holds around a tenth of the world's lions: it is the second largest lion population left after Selous, and it is one of only six lion populations left in the world that still has over 1000 lions. Ruaha also contains: one of four large cheetah populations left in East Africa; the third biggest remaining population of endangered African wild dogs; and globally important populations of spotted hyenas, leopards, and small carnivores. Beyond its carnivores, Ruaha has one of Africa's most important elephant populations and is important for critically endangered vulture species. However, these populations are by no means secure: Ruaha has been a hotspot for elephant poaching over recent years, and the area has the highest recorded rate of human-lion conflict in East Africa.
Camera Trapping
Camera-trapping (i.e. motion-activated cameras ""capture"" photographs of wild animals) is a vital research tool in this landscape, especially outside the park where wild animals are often secretive and hard to see. We have established networks of camera traps in the National Park, in the adjacent Wildlife Management Area, and on village land in order to collect information on the distribution and ecology of large carnivores and their prey.
Our camera traps have collected millions of images so far, which has provided us with invaluable information regarding our wildlife populations. Processing this massive amount of data is extremely time consuming for the research staff, as each image has to be examined, the species identified, and the number of individuals counted. Engaging citizen scientists in this process allows for the rapid turn around of data and subsequent use of such data in scientific analyses or publications.

200;Identify New Zealand animals;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/vykanton/identify-new-zealand-animals/about/research;"Why are we photographing wildlife in New Zealand cities?
Wildlife in Aotearoa (New Zealand) has evolved in an unique way due to its long isolation from other continental land masses. In the absence of terrestrial mammals, New Zealand's animals and plants have evolved characteristics unseen elsewhere in the world. Since the introduction of mammals, around 1000 years ago, Aotearoa’s unique biodiversity is threatened by mammalian predators such as rats and stoats (more info about these introduced species here).
To expand our knowledge about the impact that these introduced mammals have in urban environments, we are placing remote cameras in multiple cities of Aotearoa, New Zealand. We have collected over 100,000 photographs of animals and we need your help identifying them. Your identifications will allow us to estimate the distribution and abundance of introduced mammals in cities like Wellington, Hamilton and Dunedin. Using this information we can take action to manage urban landscapes to bring back New Zealand's unique fauna and flora to our parks, streets and gardens.
This research is part of ""People, Cities and Nature"", a research programme aiming to conserve and restore native biodiversity in urban areas of New Zealand. The photographs are collected every year so that we can study spatial and temporal changes in the number and type of introduced predators. Our findings provide guidelines for more efficient conservation management of urban environments. For more information about this programme please check here."
201;Parochial Archive Project in Rome;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/vincent-/parochial-archive-project-in-rome/about/research;"Parochial Archive Project
Much of the history of art focuses on a single artist’s life or on works of art only. With the Parochial Archive housed at the Royal Netherlands Institute in Rome (KNIR) we can broaden that scope toward the historical and social context and at the same time maintain important biographical details. At the same time, this kind of material can nowadays be researched with new methods that allow for a deeper understanding of the social dynamics of foreign communities in early modern Rome.
The Parochial Archive Project is a unique historical resource that has been worked on for over the last five decades. This paper based archive contains handwritten and typewritten transcripts of Dutch and Flemish (plus some German) nationals who lived in Rome from the 1550s until roughly the 1700s. At present, this corpus of archival transcripts is, at its most, a reference work that contains data about engravers, painters, sculptors, etc. on a detailed micro-level.
For almost forty years Elisja Schulte van Kessel has worked on the Parochial Archive Project, together with fellow researchers. During the period of her affiliation to the Royal Netherlands Institute she visited 130 Roman parishes to search through their records for fiammenghi. The denominator fiammenghi was predominantly used for the Dutch and Flemish inhabitants of Rome. The sources were transcribed from handwritten documents as physical records, not digital, so they still require transcription to be used digitally. The sources are written in French, Italian and Latin and interspersed with Dutch scribbles.
Schulte van Kessel and her assistants carefully transcribed each baptism, marriage, and death record and each stato dell’anima when a fiamengo was named. The latter, the stati dell’anime, is a record comparable to a modern-day census. Not only painters are named in this archive but also a plethora of other artisans are documented, such as bakers, goldsmiths, masons, and shoemakers.
While keeping the micro-level information intact we would like to bring all the data together in an online accessible Linked Open Database. The project’s goal is to offer historians the opportunity to pose new research questions on a macro-level while maintaining all of the micro-level details. This new way of aggregating and visualizing data will help to deepen our understanding of how the Dutch and Flemish community in Rome functioned, and how artists and artisans were connected to one another in both their private and professional lives.
With the rich corpus we can add a social hierarchical layer to the Dutch and Flemish presence, see how fiammenghi integrated within the Roman society, rediscover forgotten names, and reconstruct important artisanal studios. Many of these social historical research questions have not been touched upon since the mid-1940s, have never been adequately studied or need to be revised.
With the Parochial Archive Project as a crowdsourcing transcription project the KNIR intends to convert these transcripts into usable and freely re-usable data that will be accessible via a Linked Open Database. The database will help present and future researchers trace the contours of the larger Dutch and Flemish community in Rome. This, in turn, is one of the main research goals of the Royal Netherlands Institute in Rome.
We would like to thank you very kindly for your help. Without you (!), and we really would like to emphasize this, it would not be possible to open this extensive archive. Information acquired for over four decades would, quite literally, slowly fade away.
The three main goals of this project are:
To enrich the Linked Open Database with the transcribed data of the crowdsourcing transcription project.
a. Provide end-users with a view of the data on a macro-level while maintaining all of the micro-level details and with the goal to pose new research questions.
b. Provide end-users with data that can be freely re-used and/or enriched.
Gain important insights into how the Dutch and Flemish community in Rome functioned during the period from 1550 until 1700.
And many other unforeseen positive research outcomes of digitizing and opening up an archive.

202;League of Nations in the Digital Age;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/nshreyasvi/league-of-nations-in-the-digital-age/about/research;"Background
The League of Nations, the predecessor of the United Nations, was established in 1919 with the aim of promoting international cooperation and achieving world peace and security. The League of Nations was unsuccessful in preventing the outbreak of World War II, and finally disbanded in 1946. Despite its demise, the League of Nations continues to have an impact on our world today, because it established precedents for resolving international disputes, addressing collective security and tackling global challenges in economics, health, communications, transportation and many other fields.
Objective
The long-term objective behind this initiative is to make a full digital version of the archives of the League of Nations freely accessible and easily searchable for future generations. As a first step towards that long-term goal, the aim is to test a combination of crowdsourcing and artificial intelligence (AI) for extracting key information about each document in the archives. This Zooniverse project has been set up by a student team from the Geneva Tsinghua Initiative as part of the SDG Summer School run by Citizen Cyberlab. The team was mentored by staff of the UN Library in Geneva. The objective of this Zooniverse project is to gather a first data set for testing the combination of crowdsourcing and AI technologies.
Significance
This project contributes to the UN sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in several ways. Broad access to information about historical efforts to achieve global peace can contribute to promoting the goals of peace, justice and strong institutions (SDG 16) and partnerships (SDG 17). Above all, as UNESCO declares, ""Culture is who we are and what shapes out identity. No development can be sustainable without including culture"". These historical documents are a precious cultural heritage, so the process of digitization contributes to preserving our global culture.
Data
All documents about the League of Nations are stored in the United Nations Library in Geneva. The amount of paper data is very large, as the video introducing this project illustrates. Only a small portion of the official documents of the League of Nations archives have been digitized, and the official documents represent, in turn, just a fraction of the entire League of Nations archives stored in the UN Library. To be precise, about 750,000 pages have been digitized so far, but only about a third of that material has been
indexed and made available online.
Methodology:
Although Optical Character Recognition can help to automate the indexing of the League of Nations archives, there are a number of reasons that crowdsourcing remains useful.
Blurry or missing letters, especially in the titles and document numbers may result in
errors that in turn make the digitized documents difficult to access via search engines and other systems.
different sizes of documents, unusual fonts, multiple languages and occasionally hand -
written information can also result in digitization errors.
thin paper can result in recto-verso text overlap or bleed-through which confuses automatic systems.

203;Cheetahs of Central Namibia;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/danberinger/cheetahs-of-central-namibia/about/research;"Wildlife in Namibia: The Greater Waterberg Landscape
Introduction
In 2016, the Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF) began a camera trapping project to study prey and carnivore density across the Greater Waterberg Landscape (GWL) in Namibia. The GWL is comprised of five conservancies: Waterberg Conservancy (this is where CCF is located), Ozonahi Conservancy, Okamatapati Conservancy, Otjituuo Conservancy, and the African Wild Dog Conservancy. All totaled, the GWL contains over 19,000 sq km. This is... well, enormous! If the GWL was a country it would be larger than 100 other countries.

Map of the Greater Waterberg Landscape
Why is this Project Important?
There are only about 7,100 cheetah left in the wild and most of them are found right here in Namibia. Cheetahs are Africa's most endangered big cat. In Namibia most of them live outside of national parks, in habitats like the Greater Waterberg Landscape where humans, livestock and wildlife are all mixed together. Much of CCF's work focuses on reducing human-wildlife conflict. For cheetahs to have a chance to survive in the wild, CCF must find a way for humans and carnivores to exist side-by-side. For decades now, CCF has worked with farmers and communities to reduce livestock losses and the all-too-often revenge shooting of carnivores. They help locals realize economic value from their wildlife by encouraging tourism and other non-destructive economic activities. And CCF constantly strives to better understand the bio-diversity and dynamics of the complex ecosystem that is the Greater Waterberg Landscape.
A key foundation to all of these programs is a solid understanding of the wildlife habitat. And that is where the camera trap program plays a vital role.
The CCF camera trap project aims to find the answers to key questions such as:
what predators and prey species are present?
what are the relative population densities of each species?
how do their densities and movements vary according to wet season / dry season?
Knowing the answer to these and other questions will help us understand the ecosystem more completely and design conservation programs to protect the cheetah, other carnivores, and indeed the entire habitat.
CCF thanks the Go Green Fund and Aktionsgemeinschaft Artenschutz (AGA) for providing funding and equipment for our camera trap project.
More Details
To implement this program, CCF ecologists designed a multi-year effort to place cameras, gather photos, and analyze data. Below you can see a map representing one of the early phases of the program. Each flag indicates the location of one of the camera traps within a grid. This particular phase was located on CCF's land which is on the western end of the Greater Waterberg Landscape map shown above.
About 40 cameras were deployed in an early phase and our staff returned to the sites after about four weeks to swap out the data cards in the cameras. The first 4 weeks yielded 300,000 photos and our team set about reviewing each photo and classifying them (ie. identifying which species was seen).
Here are a few typical photos.

This is a perfect shot: easy to identify!

Of course the cameras work at night too. We want to catch all the nocturnal wildlife walking by.

Hmmm... Could you stand back a few feet please? Not all photos result in identifiable subjects! But my opinion for this shot is that a baboon came in for a very close inspection of the camera.
Our camera trap program is now in its second year. We continue to move the cameras to various areas of the GWL and have now captured over 1 million photos. Needless to say, we are having trouble classifying all these photos. This project on Zooniverse will really help out CCF. Your eyes and judgement will help us quantify the bio-diversity, better understand the status of wildlife distribution, and will ultimately lead to better conservation programs for this vital landscape. Thanks so much for helping us!"
204;Brain Match;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/simexp/brain-match/about/research;"Brain imaging is a powerful technology used to study brain disorders like Alzheimer’s Disease and Schizophrenia. To detect subtle differences between brains, sometimes thousands of brain scans need to be compared.
A critical step in this kind of study is to align images of the different brains so the anatomy matches. This process is called registration, and is a complex task, prone to errors. While a researcher will typically visually check that the brains match after registration, there are no established guidelines to judge of the quality of a registration.
This project builds on simple guidelines to assess the quality of brain registration (how well the brain images match). We hope to find that these guidelines produce consistent ratings across users. If we generate enough data we may even be able to “train computers” to better judge quality of brain registration, which would help us process huge amounts of data!
We need your help to improve brain registration!"
205;Leaf Targeting;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/venchen/leaf-targeting/about/research;"Overview
Welcome to Leaf Targeting, where we ask you to help us mark (target) leaves in plants which will eventually help feed the world. We use images to observe how plants grow and respond to a new environment, and we need to measure these changes. One direct reaction we can measure is the number of leaves a plant has. Help us measure this reaction by identifying leaves in images.
Why identify and count leaves?
By observing how plants grow, we can potentially unlock and understand complex biological processes that contribute to plant health, resistance and potential yield. Plant scientists try to do this by observing visual characteristics that we call phenotypes. The number of leaves is one of these important characteristics which indicates how healthy a plant is and how well it is growing in its current conditions (for example quality of soil, light conditions, water availability).
What are we looking for?
Quite simply you need to identify leaves in images showing a single plant. We call it 'targeting' because the tool you use has a scoping target that allows you to put a cross over a leaf.
What plants are these and how their leaf count helps us improve crops?
The images we use all come from the same plant species (Arabidopsis thaliana), a very common model plant that plant scientists use to study and understand plant biology. This plant is small (it has a diameter of 15 cm when fully grown) and grows fast (full cycle in almost 2 months). Thus scientists can grow many of them very quickly to test a variety of environmental conditions and how genetic variations affect growth. By counting their leaves we can see how fast a plant is sprouting, which is a direct aspect of growth. Thus we can see how fundamental research into Arabidospis's growth translates to our understanding of real crops.
Why do we need you?
Our affordable imaging sensors (http://phenotiki.com/) are deployed across the world and collect thousands of images every day. The tremendous amount of visual data we collect makes the job of quantifying plant reactions (such as leaf count) difficult. Our software is fast, but cannot compete with a human observer in accuracy. The human eye and brain can easily cope with challenges that trick the computer: for example different leaf size, leaves overlapping etc. Your contribution helps in many diverse ways. Firstly it helps plant scientists obtain leaf counts which they use in statistical experiments to assess plant growth and differences between different plant varieties (cultivars) and environmental conditions. At the same time by collecting more data of more diverse appearance the algorithms we develop can further improve in accuracy.
What should I expect and what else I might see?
What is challenging is when the plants are very small and you need to zoom in a lot. You will also encounter many cases when leaves overlap each other. Your eye and brain here work well if you allow them some time to process the information. This is also where the computer algorithms struggle but we know the human does better. You might also see leaves from other plants in the same image – you can safely ignore those. Please make sure you see the tutorial, we have many visual examples to help you."
206;Mutual Muses;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/melissaagill/mutual-muses/about/research;"Much of the history of visual art involves some nature of public presentation and reception. Paintings and sculptures are created to be seen; criticism and histories are written to be read. Mutual Muses provides a rare, intimate look into the private lives of two significant members of the art world in the 20th-century: Sylvia Sleigh (1916–2010), a realist painter known for her feminist principles, and Lawrence Alloway (1926–1990), a self-taught critic and curator most famously credited for coining the term ‘Pop Art.’ This collection of correspondence from the Getty Research Institute is a highly personal artifact of a couple’s romantic entanglement as it progresses through collegiality, courtship, and marriage. It is also a unique historical resource that provides art historians with detailed and personal accounts of the lives and careers of these two important figures, while also tracing the contours of the larger art movements with which they were associated.
These digitized letters, the majority of which were sent between 1948 and 1953 prior to the couple’s marriage, represent a particularly exciting moment in the personal histories of Alloway and Sleigh, and in the history of art in general. These exchanges, and the larger archives from which they came, have captured the interest of a number of researchers in the art historical field, leading to symposia, publications, and exhibitions on Alloway and related artists. By transcribing these letters, the Getty Research Institute’s Digital Art History program hopes to expand upon this work and connect this resource to other researchers that share Alloway and Sleigh’s wide-ranging interests such as modern art in Europe and the United States, science fiction, pop art, film, conceptual art, design, feminist artists, art from Latin America, and other topics.
The Getty Research Institute is a program of the J. Paul Getty Trust, along with its more famous sibling, the J. Paul Getty Museum. Located at the Getty Center in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, the Getty Research Institute is a global resource for research in the arts. In addition to special collections of rare resources like the Alloway and Sleigh correspondence, the Getty Research Institute offers a comprehensive art library collection, exhibitions, public programs, a residential scholars program, art historical databases, and more. The Digital Art History program furthers the Getty Research Institute’s commitment to fostering innovative art-historical research and scholarship through the use of tools and practices associated with digital art history.
The transcription of these letters will contribute to the field of art history in general and the field of modern art in particular. Perhaps more importantly, it cultivates a relationship with the people who use the Getty Research Institute as a resource and provides an opportunity for people to work closely with our special collections, regardless of their physical location, even if that closeness is mediated by technology. It is difficult to find a more intimate interaction with a historical figure than the one that takes place while sifting through their personal communication and learning to discern the small indicators of emotion that can become perceptible after studying their handwriting. This project seeks to facilitate that closeness in a way that enriches the user’s experience with the material while enriching the material itself.
The goals of the project are to:
1. Enrich the research value of an established digital collection from the Getty Research Institute by aiding access and discovery, and creating a resource that facilitates use and interpretation through digital methods.
2. Provide users with new opportunities for meaningful engagement with digitized special collections materials.
The outcome of this project will be delivered to the Getty Research Institute’s Special Collections department and made available online."
207;Agent NEO;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zemogle/agent-neo/about/research;"Help us find new asteroids
Agent NEO is looking for asteroids and any other moving object in images taken using the Las Cumbres Observatory global telescope network. The LCO solar system team take 30+ images every day looking for Near Earth Objects. We look for new asteroid candidates provided by the IAU Minor Planet Center (MPC), NASA Asteroid Redirect Mission, and NASA Arecibo-Goldstone Radar tracking.
We then schedule LCO to take a closer look at these candidates. Most of the time we are trying to confirm the candidate is actually an asteroid. We then get detailed measurements of its position which we send back to the MPC. They log these measurements and use them to calculate the asteroid's orbit, so we know where to find it.
Once an asteroid has been confirmed, we can study it in more detail to find out how far away it is, how big it is, and how fast it is spinning.
Why we need you!
We can train computers to find all the fuzzy blobs in each image but an algorithm is often not very good at matching fuzzy blobs between images, when the blob has moved. Faint asteroids are hard to find because they're only a little bit brighter than the background sky. This means we have to be relaxed about what sort of fuzzy blobs the code finds, otherwise we might miss the asteroids!
Sometimes the asteroids we're looking for are small and can't be distinguished from cosmic ray hits (high energy packets of light hitting our cameras, appearing as specks in the animation above). We don't remove these cosmic ray hits because they look a little too like small asteroids.
Help us to improve
This is an experiment for us. We want to improve the accuracy and efficiency of our candidate detections which is why you might initially see lots of image sequences with apparently no asteroid. It is still really useful for us to know if you don't see an asteroid, but it will allow us to refine our moving object detection scripts.
We'll give you credit
This is a really important task, so if you find an asteroid in the images, we will make sure you get the credit. Your Zooniverse username will be reported to the Minor Planet Center as one of the 'Measurers' of the asteroid you've helped find. Your username will then be listed on the Minor Planet Center Electronic Circulars (MPECs) for the observations of the asteroid.
When will there be new data?
Our data sets are small-ish but regular. We take new data every night (except for a few days around full moon) but not all of it is good enough quality to send to you. We don't want to waste your time looking through data we can't use.
We aim to release new subject sets every couple of days unless but we are reliant on survey telescopes telling us where to point.
1 Aug 2017: One of the main survey missions Catalina Sky Survey will be shutdown for a few weeks because of monsoon. This means we will have many fewer candidates to follow up on. We'll let you know when we get more data.

208;Weddell Seal Count;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/slg0808/weddell-seal-count/about/research;"Summary
We want to count how many Weddell seals there are in the Ross Sea area of Antarctica. Only then can we tell if they are being adversely affected by human fishing for toothfish, or by the ice melting away beneath them due to climate change. But it is really hard to count seals – they live in very remote hard-to-reach locations where weather conditions are extreme, and they spend a lot of their time in the water. But during the summer they haul out onto the ice for some time each day. If we can count them then, and also understand the typical pattern of numbers out on the ice, then perhaps we can make reasonable estimates of the population.
In October 2016 the nations represented at the Commission for the Conservation of Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) reached consensus on a New Zealand/United States proposal to establish the world's largest marine protected area (MPA) in the Ross Sea region. The Agreement will enter into force on 1 December 2017. The ability to monitor the health of the MPA will be very important in assessing its effectiveness.
The Ross Sea region of Antarctica is home to more than half the total population of Pacific Weddell Seals. Weddell seals and orca are among the top predators in the Ross Sea region, and act as sentinel species for the ecosystem. Knowledge of changes in their population numbers would give important insights into the health of the whole ecosystem, and the effectiveness of the MPA. It has been demonstrated that it is possible to identify seals hauled out onto the ice in satellite images, although they are at the limit of picture resolution. Satellites potentially provide a great way of covering the enormous area of the western Ross Sea, and therefore helping to monitor the population of the entire region.
However, previous studies have shown that the number of seals visible depends strongly on the time of day, sometimes by as much as a factor 10. To get a reasonable estimate of the total population from the number counted from an image taken at one time, you need to know what fraction of the population you might expect to see on the ice at that time of day.

We would like to understand the daily rhythm of the seals hauling out onto the ice. We have pictures from two cameras on Turtle Rock, off Ross Island, showing seals hauled out near tidal cracks in the sea ice. The cameras were automated to take pictures at 10-minute intervals over a period of weeks during the breeding season in November and December 2014, and again in 2015. By counting the seals in the pictures we can plot the numbers not only over one or two days, but several months, helping us better understand the daily pattern of haul out and how it changes during the season.
Background
Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) are found all around Antarctica, with McMurdo Sound (77°S) the most southerly extent. They are the most southerly breeding mammal and are the only Antarctic marine mammal that lives preferentially within areas of fast ice, that is, sea ice adjacent to land or ice shelves that is continuous except for small cracks caused by tidal action. The seals haul out onto the ice surface to rest, in spring to give birth to and nurse their pups, and in January to March to moult prior to the melt of the sea ice. While in the fast ice far from open water, the seals and their pups are safe from predators such as killer whales and leopard seals that are unable to cross closed ice. Weddell seals can locate the tide cracks in the ice that form near headlands, islands and glacier fronts, and make and maintain holes that allow them to breathe and haul out. Unlike other seals, Weddell seals have protruding canine teeth and caniniform (canine-like) second incisors that they use to abrade the ice and create holes along tidal cracks, where the ice is much thinner than elsewhere. The ability to find and maintain holes deep within the fast ice gives Weddell seals access to the water to feed, and for breathing when in the water. The downside of the specialised fast-ice niche of the Weddel seal is that life expectancy is limited by tooth wear.

In this project, we are particularly interested in the seals in the south-western extreme of the Ross Sea, in McMurdo Sound (ca. 77°20'S, 165°20'E). Weddell seals show a strong preference for returning to the place of their birth. During the breeding season, females rearing their pups gather in colonies along cracks in the fast ice starting in mid-October. They are joined by some other females. Meanwhile, the adult males patrol stay in the water and patrol their claim along the tidal crack - these areas are called 'maritories in analogy to 'territories' - and are rarely seen on the surface unless they are soundly defeated. It is common for injured males to haul out onto the sea ice and there die from their injuries.

Ross Island is a volcanic island at the edge of the Ross Ice Shelf, and has two large mountains at its centre, including the active Mt. Erebus (3,794 m). The picture below shows the bay into which the Erebus Glacier Tongue empties, on the south-western side of Ross Island. Weddell seals gather around the islands and places where the tidal movement weakens the sea ice as it presses against the land.

A satellite picture can capture large areas in a single image, and it is possible to zoom in so that you can see the dots of seals hauled up on the ice.

Courtesy of Google Earth, a satellite image of Turtle Rock with the seals visible as small black dots. I have indicated the location of our cameras.
However, the drawback of satellite images is their relatively low resolution that makes is difficult to count the seals accurately. Pups cannot be distinguished from adults and fail to be detected due to their smaller size. On the other hand, it would be very helpful to be able to make use of aerial or satellite images because they cover very large areas much more efficiently than travelling out onto the ice and surveying by counting on the ground. This is particularly important if we want to estimate the entire population of the western Ross Sea, i.e., the seals influenced by the Ross Sea Region MPA. The islands in Erebus Bay are only kilometres apart, and manual counts take days or weeks, and are expensive because of the logistics required to move around. The northern extent of the western coastline of the Ross Sea, Cape Adare, is 750 km away and only reachable by air in good weather.

Satellite or aerial pictures can give a snapshot of the seals on the ice at one moment during the day. We know that the numbers of seals above and below the ice vary very significantly during the day, up to a factor of 10 over a 24-hour cycle. Thus, to be able to compare pictures taken at different times, and to infer total numbers by correcting for seals invisible below the ice, it is important to have a good understanding of the daily haul-out cycle and whether (how) it changes throughout the seasons. That is what we are seeking to achieve in this study, through taking photographs at 10 minute intervals from the same location over a long period of time.
Two land-based automated cameras captured images in two directions from points on Turtle Rock, Erebus Bay. The pictures were taken every 10 minutes over the periods from 27th November 2014 through to 01st January 2015. After that, we had to move the cameras because the ice became unstable, cutting off our access to the island. We have approximatley 10,000 pictures altogether. We are asking Zooniverse volunteers to help us count the seals in these pictures.

Concerns about the impacts of fishing upon Weddell seals.
The picture below shows in schematic form the main elements of the food web in the Ross Sea. Weddell seals are top predators, feeding on krill, squid, silverfish and toothfish, in order of increasing size. The picture shows that they compete for toothfish with type-C killer whales and human fisheries.
Toothfish are important to Weddell seals because they provide a very high-energy-density source of food, potentially key to allowing seals to recover from enormous weight-loss during the breeding season. Weddell seal pups weigh about 25 - 30 kgs at birth, but within the 6-8 weeks reach about 70-140+ kg., gaining approximately 2-3 kg/day. Mothers lose up to 40% of their body mass while feeding their pups. Males also lose significant body weight during the breeding season, because they spend all their time in the water around the access holes defending their territory and have no time to feed.

After losing almost half of their postpartum weight during the period October to December, Weddell seals feed intensively to regain condition, but this is interrupted by the annual moult. It is an area of active research to investigate their feeding patterns during this period. While there are plenty of toothfish in McMurdo Sound, Weddell seals could be affected if the availability of toothfish during this critical period is decreased. If there are fewer toothfish, then potentially it is more difficult for the seals to recover from the loss of body mass during the breeding season, and are therefore less fit to breed the following season, which in turn impacts the population numbers.

Fishing quotas for toothfish are regulated by CCAMLR and are derived from a precautionary approach, which seeks to ensure that stocks are harvested in a sustainable manner. It is a matter of on-going debate as to the extent of fishery impacts upon toothfish populations and other top predators. Protecting the foraging areas of marine mammal predators including Weddell seals was an important motivation for the establishment of the Ross Sea region MPA. This highlights again the need for effective monitoring programmes which can deliver robust estimates of current populations. This project seeks to contribute to the development of effective monitoring of Weddell seals through a better understanding of the patterns in their visible presence on the ice.

We are studying jaguars at two sites in Panama: Darién National Park and Soberanía National Park. Although both are tropical forests, they differ in terms of their wildlife and human presence in the park. Darién is an extremely remote park located on the Colombian border and can only be reached by boat or on foot. The tropical forest ecosystem is nearly pristine and is home to many large animals like jaguars, pumas, tapirs, peccaries, harpy eagles, and macaws. But as people establish cattle ranches and farms in the surrounding area, the park’s wildlife is becoming threatened. In contrast, Soberanía has long been affected by human activities due to its location alongside the Panama Canal and close proximity to Panama’s two largest cities. Many of the large animals that are found in Darién have either disappeared or are very rare in Soberanía. We are using trail cameras to study which animals are continuing to thrive in Soberanía, and how jaguars and other large animals in Darién are responding to an increasing human presence in the area.
Jaguar Research
Our research is focused on jaguars and two of their main prey animals: tapirs and white-lipped peccaries. Tapirs and peccaries are large herbivores that play an important role in tropical forests by dispersing seeds. Jaguars are the top predators in this ecosystem and keep herbivore numbers in check, maintaining the food web in equilibrium. Because all three species are sensitive to any environmental disturbance and populations are relatively small, any changes in species numbers can signal to scientists a change in the health of the forest. Our main goal is to identify the environmental and human factors that affect the numbers, habitat use, and movements of these three species.
One of our research tools consists of trail cameras that we set up at locations where jaguars, tapirs, and peccaries are likely to pass. The cameras have motion sensors that snap a photo when an animal moves by. Cameras are placed in pairs to photograph both sides of the animal. Because jaguars and other spotted cats have slightly different patterns on their left and right sides, having both sides photographed enables us to recognize individuals. Cameras are set up at each site for several months. We visit each site regularly to check that the cameras are still working, replace the batteries, and change the memory cards that store thousands of images.
In Soberanía, jaguars and tapirs are rare, and white-lipped peccaries have been gone for many decades. We began using trail cameras here in 2013 to monitor these species and document their presence to ensure their continued protection. In Darién, where all three species are more common, we have placed a larger network of trail cameras at several locations both near settlements and in undisturbed forest to study how humans are impacting these species. Trail cameras not only help us to understand animals’ lives, but also provide critical information on how to protect them and conserve the ecosystems they inhabit.
Help Us Collect Data
We have collected thousands of photos (and counting), and we need your help to identify the animals in these photos! Your identifications will build a data set that scientists can use to learn more about the animals in Darién and Soberanía. This information helps us understand how the animals in the park are responding to humans and identify ways to better protect them. Ready to get started?

Our remote-triggered cameras collect tens of thousands of photos each year. Because of this overwhelming amount of data, we need your help identifying the wildlife you see in these photos. With your help, we can process and analyze the data much faster than if we did it on our own. Also, we hope that you will enjoy looking at the diversity of wildlife on Vail Pass. Please read below for more information on the project. Thank you for your support!
Background
The Vail Pass Wildlife Byway on Interstate 70 (I-70), between Copper Mountain Resort and the top of Vail Pass, has long been identified as an important movement corridor for wildlife in Colorado. Most recently, the Summit County Safe Passages for Wildlife Connectivity Plan (the Plan), initiated by the U.S. Forest Service, identified the Vail Pass Wildlife Byway as a top priority area in which to focus wildlife mitigation efforts in the near term. The Plan, completed in 2017, was developed by a diverse group of stakeholders and provides a common vision for multi-species landscape connectivity throughout the county.
The Vail Pass Wildlife Byway, encompassed entirely by the White River National Forest, is important habitat for many wildlife species, including elk, mule deer and the only known breeding population of Canada lynx in Colorado outside the southwest corner of the state. Yet wildlife movement and habitat in the area are at risk due to the heavy and increasing traffic volumes on I-70, up to 22,000 vehicles on an average day. This much traffic presents a significant barrier to wildlife, with many animals no longer attempting to cross the roadway, or doing so unsuccessfully. Moreover, collisions with wildlife pose an extraordinary safety concern for motorists, resulting in property damage, injuries and fatalities, at a cost to society of $66.4 million per year in Colorado.
Wildlife Overpasses and Underpasses: A Solution
To restore connectivity in the area, three wildlife crossing structures – one overpass and two underpasses – have been recommended in the Plan to allow for the safe passage of wildlife over or under I-70 in the Vail Pass Wildlife Byway. Such structures, if instituted across North America, would more than pay for themselves in a matter of years, reconnecting the landscape and reducing collisions with wildlife by as much as 97 percent.

Wildlife Monitoring with Remote Triggered Cameras - Colorado Corridors Project
Wildlife monitoring is an essential step in assessing whether wildlife crossing structures are effective in restoring connectivity for wildlife moving across the landscape. The Colorado Corridors Project is an initiative of Denver Zoo and Rocky Mountain Wild to engage volunteers in wildlife monitoring at the Vail Pass Wildlife Byway proposed overpass location. Volunteers assist with setting up and checking remote-triggered cameras in the field as well as identifying and cataloging species captured on the cameras through Zooniverse. The wildlife data that volunteers help us collect through this project will be used to assess the effectiveness of the wildlife crossing structure by comparing data collected before and after construction of the overpass."
211;Galaxy Nurseries;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/hughdickinson/galaxy-nurseries/about/research;"Baby galaxy hunters
From dazzling spirals to mammoth ellipticals to wispy dwarfs, galaxies have been fascinating people since they first appeared in our telescopes. And like us, galaxies grow and evolve over time. Unlike us, however, galactic evolution takes place on scales of millions to billions of years, meaning that observing any meaningful change in any individual galaxy is impossible on human timescales, leaving scientists interested in studying galactic evolution in a bit of a bind!
But there is a solution to this problem! Photons, particles of light, do not travel instantaneously but rather at a finite speed. This means that observations of distant galaxies serve as cosmic time capsules; the light from a galaxy one billion light years away has been in transit for one billion years, meaning that we are seeing that galaxy as it was a billion years ago.
With Galaxy Nurseries, we aim to discover lots of new galaxies very far away from us, in earlier stages of their development, and pass them on to the wider astronomical community. Finding galaxies and measuring their distance, however, is not easy! The WISP survey, which produced the data you will analyze, is great for this task. With WISP, we observe galaxies in two different ways, by taking both direct images of galaxies and images of galaxies' light split into different colors (or images of galaxies' spectra). This allows us to simultaneously find new galaxies (from the images) and measure their distances (from the spectra).
We have computer code that tries to do this for us, but the code produces many bogus detections of galaxies that must be filtered out by humans. By filtering the automatically identified galaxies from the false positives, you will help us discover some among the youngest and smallest galaxies known. In addition, we can use your classifications to create a new generation of galaxy detecting algorithms, one less susceptible to being fooled by spurious detections.
The WISP survey
WISP is Hubble Space Telescope project that uses the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) in pure parallel mode. While the Hubble Space Telescope is observing one region of the sky with a different instrument, we are using the WFC3 camera simultaneously (in parallel) on a nearby patch of the sky - a very efficient and cost--effective strategy to obtain spectra for a large number of objects.
WISP obtains both images and spectra of all galaxies in the field of the instrument. When we take images of galaxies' spectra, the white light that enters the camera is decomposed into its many colors, each color corresponding to different wavelengths of light waves, similar to what happens when a rainbow is formed in the atmosphere after a storm. When certain atoms are present in the galaxy, that galaxy will emit light much more strongly at certain specific colors. We call these peaks in the spectrum ""emission lines.""

Measuring a galaxy's spectrum. Image Credit: Vihang Mehta
There is a lot a galaxy's emission lines can tell us about the galaxy; for example, if hydrogen lines are present in a galaxy's spectrum, that tells us that hydrogen is being ionized in the galaxy. Since hydrogen can only be ionized by very young, hot stars, we know that young stars are present in the galaxy, meaning that the galaxy is actively forming stars! Furthermore, since we know the exact color hydrogen lines are naturally, we can tell how fast the galaxy is moving away from us by how much the lines have been redshifted. Then, we use Hubble's law to relate the speed of the receding galaxy to how far it is from us.

Be wary, though! Not everything that appears to be an emission line is in fact an emission line. There are various sources of contamination we have to be careful of, contamination that originates from the detector itself and from stars and galaxies close to the target. Sources of contamination are detailed in the field guide, which you will want to familiarize yourself with if you want to be an expert baby galaxy hunter."
212;Supernova Sighting;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/skymap/supernova-sighting/about/research;"Join ABC Stargazing Live at Siding Spring observatory in the search for supernovae!
The team at the SkyMapper Telescope at Siding Spring observatory in Australia have teamed up with ABC Stargazing Live to get you to help out in the search for supernovae. We are observing an area of sky ~1,000 times larger than the full Moon every night!
How do we find Supernovae?
Supernovae are ""transient events"", they shine very brightly for weeks and then fade away. A good way of finding transient objects in the sky is to compare an ""old"" or ""reference"" image to a ""new"" image. If a bright object appears on the ""new"" image which was not visible a month ago we have found a transient event! Usually we call this process subtraction, which is literally subtracting the new image from the old, so if you have a particular star or a galaxy in the ""new"" and ""old"" image there will be no event (transient) in the ""subtracted"" image.
Supernovae will usually appear like point sources (small white dots of light). They can occur near or in galaxies. Some don't seem to be in a galaxy (usually the galaxy is too faint to be seen or is not close to the supernova) and others can be seen in their galaxy like:
Transients can be supernovae but also stars that vary their luminosity, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) found in the centres of a galaxies, and even asteroids passing by! Remember, we are taking snapshots in time with our telescope. So once we find a transient candidate, which you can do in this page, we have to figure out what type of object this is. We then go to get the spectrum of the object using a special type of telescope called a spectrograph.
Supernovae as the Deaths of Stars
Supernovae are the explosive, violent deaths of stars. A single supernova can outshine its entire host galaxy for a period of a few short weeks before it fades away forever. In the image below the ""blue"" dot is a single star exploding as a supernova (SN2012fr), outshining millions of stars in this galaxy.

Most of the elements heavier than iron are forged in these short explosions. Over the course of billions of years, supernovae have shaped galaxies, filling them with atoms that lead to planets and life. Supernovae are also incredibly useful for measuring distances in our Universe.
Supernovae are all unique. The explosion depends on the way the star or stellar system ends its life, which can produce “normal” or “weird” explosions. We can classify broad types of supernovae by studying the rainbow of light they emit, known as the spectrum. The spectra of different types of supernovae have characteristic brighter and darker sections in their spectrum, known as emission and absorption lines respectively. The spectral lines depend on the different elements produced in the supernova, so act like a fingerprint. Each type of supernova has an expected spectral fingerprint.
We can analyse the spectra using instruments known as spectrographs, which break up the light into rainbows. Some supernova spectral lines belong to left over hydrogen and helium. Other supernovae that are produced by the death of massive stars, that are around 10 times the mass of the Sun, contain lots of heavy elements larger than iron that were produced by nuclear fusion in the explosion.
The two main types of supernovae are known as core collapse and thermonuclear supernovae. Core collapse supernovae mark the deaths of massive stars, as they run out of fuel. Core collapse supernovae produce extremely dense objects such as neutron stars and black holes, alongside beautiful nebulae. Thermonuclear supernovae are the detonations of compact objects, known as white dwarfs, caused by either two white dwarfs colliding, or material falling onto the white dwarf from a companion star. The thermonuclear explosions are incredibly bright and play a critical role in modern cosmology.
Although we can classify supernovae with spectroscopic classification, every case will be slightly different. Supernovae with large variations can lead to some exciting discoveries, so keep an eye out for peculiar looking supernovae!
##How do we use supernova to measure the age of the Universe?##
When we search for supernovae, there are many different types we can find. A special type of supernovae explode at the same brightness wherever they are in the Universe. These are called Type 1a supernovae and we can compare how bright they appear to us, to how bright they should be to work out how far away they are. We can also split the light from a supernova into its component parts using a prism in order to work out how much that light has been stretched by the expansion of space on its way to us on Earth. Using both the distance of a supernova and this measure of the expansion of space, we can work out the rate at which the Universe is expanding. From this we can work backwards, to rewind time, and work out how old the Universe is.
Astronomers have been doing this calculation for decades with ever increasing numbers of supernovae. Every time we find another supernova, our calculation of the age of the Universe gets more precise. By helping to classify images on Supernova Sighting you will be contributing to on going scientific research to help understand the Universe in which we live. This is a field of research called cosmology.
Supernovae as Tools for Cosmology
Cosmology is the study of how the Universe evolves over time. The tools of cosmology are bright objects that can be seen far across the Universe. Supernovae, which are often about 5 billion times brighter than the Sun, can be seen from billions of light years away. In particular, we are interested in type Ia supernovae which tend to all behave in a similar way, shining very brightly to a known luminosity and then fading away. They are known as ‘standard candles’ because we know how intrinsically bright they should be, allowing us to calculate their distance based on how bright they appear to us here on Earth. Type Ia supernovae are identified by having no hydrogen or helium in their spectrum but strong evidence of silicon (produced in the explosion).
Type Ia supernovae were used by two competing teams of scientists to measure the Universe's rate of expansion, leading them to find that the rate of expansion is accelerating. This discovery was surprising because gravity, the main force shaping the Universe as a whole, is (in our daily experience) only attractive. The accelerated expansion is like throwing a ball into the air and watching it shoot off towards the Moon rather than coming back down to the ground. The unknown cause of the phenomenon is commonly referred to as ""dark energy"", and its discovery won the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics for Prof. Brian Schmidt (ANU), Prof. Saul Perlmutter (Berkeley) and Prof. Adam Riess (Johns Hopkins).
Understanding dark energy is now a major international research enterprise, with many new telescopes, surveys, and missions dedicated to the problem. The SkyMapper Transient Survey is searching for type Ia supernovae and using them to study the expansion of the Universe, with this project you are invited to participate in the search using real telescope images!
The Different Types of Supernovae
Supernovae and other transient events are usually classified with information from a telescope with a spectrograph. This telescope splits the light into different wavelengths (colours) to obtain a spectrum. This spectrum will tell us the chemical decomposition of the object, allowing us to accurately identify it.
Unlike stars or galaxies, features in supernova spectra are very broad (due to the large speeds at which the explosions eject material) and often overlap with each other. They also change with time, as layers of material expand and become transparent to reveal deeper layers (the star’s interior) underneath. Getting the most out of a new supernova requires that it be found and classified as early as possible.
To ensure access to spectroscopy, the SkyMapper team uses the ANU 2.3m telescope at Siding Spring and collaborates with the Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO) and LCO.
SkyMapper
The SkyMapper Southern Sky Survey is a project to make a digital map of the southern hemisphere, much like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) did for the northern hemisphere. SkyMapper is located in Siding Spring Observatory in Australia. Alongside the Southern Sky Survey, SkyMapper is conducting a search for supernovae and other transients. This Transient Survey covers a large area of the southern sky (2000 Square Degrees) and is optimised for the discovery and follow-up of low-redshift (nearby) type Ia supernovae to constrain cosmic expansion and peculiar velocities. The images that you will find in this project have been freshly observed from the telescope within the last few days so that we can detect supernova candidates as early as possible.

SkyMapper observes the sky in a custom-made set of filters optimised for studying extremely old, nearly metal-free stars; high-redshift quasars; and supernovae."
213;Serengeti Wildebeest Count;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/dl-j/serengeti-wildebeest-count/about/research;"Each year, enormous herds of wildebeest and zebra move thousands of kilometers across the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem in what is often called “the great migration”. Numerous predators depend on these herds and follow them closely as they move. These herds have a pivotal role in maintaining the ecosystem, from supporting other biodiversity to impacting the grass growth and frequency of fires. This remarkable phenomenon is an important part of what makes this region so unique.
The Serengeti ecosystem wildebeest count, which normally happens every two to three years, is essential to document and monitor the health of the wildebeest herds as a way of understanding the health of the entire ecosystem. The images shown here are from the 21st count since 1957.
The timing for the count depends on the wildebeest being evenly disbursed and not hidden by trees so that all individuals can been see from by air. This normally only happens only for a few weeks each year on the short grass plains in eastern Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Conservation Area and Loliondo Game Controlled Area.
In addition, although the herds normally follow a general clockwise pattern across the ecosystem, the rains are not always on time and the wildebeest often zigzag back and forth in order to find the best grass, sometimes traveling hundreds of extra kilometres. While we can assume very generally when they may reach the short grass plains, it is difficult to predict exactly which days the wildebeest will be in both the right place and in the necessary distribution for counting.
When the wildebeest are adequately distributed for the count to happen, the count team fly hundreds of kilometres of carefully plotted transects over the herds. These transects were designed for statistical accuracy, and photos were taken from the plane using strict protocol.
Finally, the images are counted. Here we are using you, citizen scientists, to assist us in the counting. Each image is counted multiple times and then the tallies combined into a statistical model which is used to calculate the final population estimate."

215;Focus on Wildlife -- Cleveland Metroparks;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/pat-lorch/focus-on-wildlife-cleveland-metroparks/about/research;"The Problem
Cities have become the primary habitat for humans on our planet. The year 2008 marked the first time in human history that the majority of people lived in urban places. Over 1.5 million people are added to our population each week, and the majority of this growth is absorbed into cities. Our great urban migration has two major consequences for natural communities. First, the incredible strain we place on natural resources is increasingly concentrated in and around urbanized centers. Second, for the majority of humans worldwide, the city has become the primary context for interacting with and experiencing nature and wildlife. Thus, our cities are placing unprecedented demands on natural resources while simultaneously serving as humankind’s primary access point to nature. Despite this accelerating pace of urbanization and its consequences for both natural systems and human perceptions of nature, the discipline that studies these issues – urban ecology – is a relatively new and undeveloped branch of science. As a result, nearly all ecological theory regarding wildlife communities has been established in wild, rural, or non-urbanized contexts. This means that we know very little about urban wildlife ecology and even less about the best practices for conservation and the human-nature connection in the context of cities.
The Solution
To address these challenges, we have formed a partnership between Cleveland Metroparks and Michigan State University to launch Focus on Wildlife, a large-scale, multidisciplinary, long-term urban ecology project in Cleveland, Ohio. Collaboratively, we seek to understand the mechanisms shaping the distribution and abundance of wildlife throughout the park system. We are testing some of the fundamental hypotheses of ecology in an extensive urban ecosystem to see if theories derived in the wild hold true in urban settings. These include the theory of island biogeography, which models the relationship between biodiversity and geographical area, and predator-prey theory, including the ‘landscape of fear’ concept. We are likewise investigating human-wildlife conflicts in an effort to enable humans and wildlife to thrive side-by-side in the city. We are also examining how human perception of the parks relates to their ecological characteristics so that we can improve our education and outreach strategies for connecting people with nature in the city. Collectively, these research efforts will advance the nascent field of urban ecology and ensure that urban parks are ecologically healthy refuges for both wildlife and people.

The Cleveland Metroparks is an astounding and unique urban ecosystem, perfectly suited to study wildlife community ecology and human-nature interactions in an urban context. The Metroparks are composed of 18 parks with over 23,000 acres of natural habitat, including rolling rivers, breath-taking waterfalls, and miles and miles of forest. Deer, coyote, fox, raccoon, and many other mammals call the Metroparks their home. The parks are also a haven for hundreds of bird species, host amazing plant diversity, and serve as a destination for millions of park visitors seeking to connect with nature. In close partnership with our Metroparks collaborators, we have deployed hundreds of wildlife cameras throughout this system in an effort to study this ecosystem without disturbing it. We have paired each of these cameras with a long-term vegetation monitoring plot, which will enable us to model human-wildlife-vegetation relationships with an unprecedented level of detail at multiple scales.
Phase 2
In the early stages of this project, we learned that the volume of images from this project can be overwhelming. Volunteers fatigued very quickly when they had to look through large numbers of images with no animals present or at large numbers of pictures of the same squirrel. We set about trying to find a way to use machine learning approaches (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) to help eliminate the tedious parts of the workflow. We enlisted the help of Matt Sochor and Josiah Olson, computer programmers working for Progressive Insurance, who volunteered to help us build a machine learning model. They built a model that can quickly sort through images and eliminate the ""nothing there"" images while classifying species as well. We trained the model with a subset of the over 200,000 images classified by Zooniverse volunteers and undergraduate volunteers from the RECaP lab at Michigan State. In phase two of the project we will be putting up on this Zooniverse project images from 10 species that the model had difficulty classifying correctly in initial training rounds. This will help us produce a second training set so that we can further improve the model and allow us to focus volunteer efforts on different questions such as finding the rare species that the model does not know how to classify or asking whether dogs are on or off leash, etc.
Citizen Science and Underrepresented Groups
We are enthusiastic about involving both the public and groups traditionally underrepresented in the natural sciences in this project. Many of our sites in the Metroparks are maintained by dedicated volunteers and we are developing a Zooniverse citizen science project so that anyone with a computer and an interest in urban wildlife can take part in Focus on Wildlife. Conducting research in the city affords access to a diversity of students, citizens, and researchers. We are promoting diversity via various avenues, such as mentorship of high school interns through the Multicultural Apprenticeship Program at Michigan State University."
216;Chicago Wildlife Watch;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/chicago-wildlife-watch/about/research;"Science
Cities can be hostile places for wildlife, with threats coming from habitat destruction, roads and traffic, humans, pets and large numbers of invasive species. However, with proper management, urban areas can house a number of important wildlife species, including carnivores and small mammals.
To assess the biodiversity of the greater Chicagoland area, Lincoln Park Zoo’s Urban Wildlife Institute has established monitoring stations within city parks, forest preserves, golf courses and cemeteries in parts of Cook, Lake, DuPage and Will Counties including downtown Chicago. Motion-triggered cameras are deployed four times per year at more than 100 sites to determine which species are present and to assess spatial and long-term patterns in wildlife communities.
Knowing where Chicago’s urban wildlife is located will help us to better conserve it. This knowledge will pave the way for future studies on the behavior and ecology of specific urban species, helping stakeholders to better manage wildlife conflict.
Keep an eye out for the black pouches that are often attached to trees in most of the photos. They contain a scented lure that increases the probability of photographing the wildlife community at a site.
Our Scientific Questions
Where do they go?
We don’t know as much as we’d like about species in urban systems. Even basic facts like what types of habitat attract which species are often unknown in areas like cities. Finding out where certain species are most likely to occur allows us to target conservation and management efforts to ensure we can coexist with our wildlife neighbors.
How are they doing?
While we can’t directly measure populations with the data from our cameras, we can get a sense of which species are most common and which may be in decline. This can help us make recommendations about how to improve conditions for the species that are in trouble.
How do they compete?
We know almost nothing about how species in urban areas might compete with one another, engage in predator-prey dynamics or avoid each other. Preliminary results indicate that the normal community interactions we observe in natural systems don’t apply to urban areas, where entirely new dynamics seem to be in place. By evaluating our camera images, we can begin to assemble the first complete picture of an urban ecosystem, including how all the species interact.
How do they interact with us?
By also collecting data on humans, and on pets like cats and dogs, we can get a sense of how animals in urban settings react to the people who make the city their home. Some animals may be attracted to sites that are often visited by humans, while others may be looking for more secluded places. Humans are a critical part of the system, and our camera data allows us to understand our impact, as well as the importance of food and habitat."
217;Arizona BatWatch;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/arizona-batwatch/about/research;"This page has information about the project, the bats, the videos, and the data.
About the project
This project creates a website where scientists and the public work together to study the behavior of lesser long-nosed bats (Leptonycteris curasoae) as the bats enter and exit a roost located in Arizona. Participants watch videos and identify the behaviors they see.
The Talk section provides a forum for collaboration and discussion. All participants are encouraged to post interesting behaviors they find, share comments about their observations, or ask questions about the project. Educational resources and links to other bat-related websites are also available.
This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1223908. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.
The problem
Scientists know relatively little about the behavior of many North American bat species in their native environments. That is because bat behaviors are hard to study in the wild. Bats tend to be small, active at night when it is hard to see them, and easily disturbed when they are in their roosts.
Most research around bat roosts focuses on timing (when bats exit the roost in the evening or return in the morning) and how often they come and go during the night. Little to no research focuses on what the bats are doing as they come and go. Scientists know that many species of bats will spend time flying in circles either inside the roost or outside the roost. But little is known beyond that general observation.
The solution
Studying bat behaviors in the wild is becoming easier thanks to improvements in technology. Infrared and near infrared cameras are now able to remotely record bat behaviors in and around bat roosts. However, one study can produce thousands of hours of video. Someone has to watch all those videos and identify the behaviors.
We are asking the public to help us watch the videos and record the behaviors they see because lots of eyes can watch the videos faster than just one or two scientists. By working together, we can process the videos faster and learn more about the bats’ behaviors.
One exciting aspect of the project is that there is so much to learn about bat behaviors in the wild. This leaves lots of room for discovery and participants may notice new behaviors that scientists didn’t know about.
Future goals
The overall problem of using videos to study bat behaviors isn’t limited to lesser long-nosed bats flying around a roost. The problem applies to any bat research project using video to record behavior.
Our long-term goal is to develop a larger program that creates similar websites for bat researchers across the country. The new websites may focus on different species, different behaviors, or both.
About the bats
Lesser long-nosed bats (Leptonycteris curasoae) are an endangered bat that feeds on nectar and pollen of many southwestern species, including columnar cacti and agave. An adult lesser long-nosed bat is approximately 3 inches long, or half the length of a dollar bill, from its nose to its tail. Its wingspan is approximately 12-13 inches wide or about the length of two $1 bills.
Lesser long-nosed bats migrate between Mexico and southern Arizona and New Mexico. Their migration follows the blooms of the plants they pollinate. Because lesser long-nosed bats are nectar feeders, they can often be seen at hummingbird feeders in urban and suburban areas within their range. They are famous for emptying hummingbird feeders that are left out overnight.
Lesser long-nosed bats roost in caves and abandoned mines during the day. In the spring and early summer, the females form maternity colonies consisting of the females and their young. Male lesser long-nosed bats form separate roosts in other caves or mines during the spring and early summer.
Female lesser long-nosed bats give birth to a single baby, called a pup, each year. In Arizona, the pups are born in May. The pups start to fly and venture out of the maternity roosts in late June. By late summer, the bats regroup to form larger, late-summer roosts that include males, females, and the young bats.
Despite being long distance migrators, lesser long-nosed bats typically only fly 10-15 miles away from the roost to look for food. Habitat destruction resulting in the loss of agave and columnar cacti that the bats rely on for food is a primary reason why the lesser long-nosed bat is endangered. Destruction of roost sites and disturbance during the maternity season are other factors contributing to the species’ endangered status.
About the videos
The videos were recorded during the annual population counts of lesser long-nosed bats. Scientists used night vision goggles to count the bats at the same time the cameras recorded the videos. The videos were originally used to check the accuracy of the scientists’ population counts. Now, we want to use those same videos to study the bats’ behaviors as they fly around the roost.
The videos feature an old mine that is located in Arizona and is a fall roosting site for the lesser long-nosed bats. A large, 6-sided gate surrounds the entrance to the mine. Six cameras, one for each side of the gate, were set up to record the bats as they entered and exited the mine. Infrared lights were also placed around the mine to provide extra light for the cameras. (Infrared light doesn’t disturb the bats.) The cameras recorded video from sunup to sundown.
When watching the videos, remember that they were recorded in the field. Vegetation and rocks block some portions of the video. The glare from infrared cameras aimed at one side of the gate may make it more difficult to see what is happening in the video on another side of the gate. Or, the viewing angle may be wider or narrower than you might wish. These are all challenges that scientists have to deal with when conducting this type of research. The cameras and lights were set up to give the best overall coverage of all sides of the gate. It is understood that no video from any single side of the gate provides a perfect view.

We would like to thank the researchers who recorded the videos, the citizen scientists who helped analyze the videos, and the project team who created Arizona BatWatch.
Data collection:
The videos were originally recorded for population verification as part of Arizona’s annual population counts of lesser long-nosed bats. For Arizona BatWatch, we divided the videos into 20-second clips with 1-second of overlap at the beginning and end of each video.
Citizen scientists participating in Arizona BatWatch watch the video clips and answer questions about the number of bats in the video, the behaviors of the bats in the video, and whether other animals were seen in the video. Each video clip is watched and coded by 30 participants.
Beta test results:
In early 2015, a beta test was conducted using eight 30-second video clips of the data. Up to 103 citizen scientist watched and coded each video. Up to six bat researchers (experts) watched and coded the same eight videos. All participants (citizen scientists and experts) could watch as many or as few videos as they wanted.
Through the beta test, we discovered that the experts sometimes disagreed about whether a rare or hard to identify behavior was present when they watched the videos independently. With most of the videos containing multiple bats, all doing different things at the same time, it was easy for any individual to miss a behavior. However, by looking at the aggregate of data individually collected by multiple people, most behaviors present were identified by at least one individual within the group. Therefore, we focused the analysis of our beta test data on two questions.
Can a group of citizen scientists with a wide variety of experience levels code the videos as accurately as a group of bat researchers?
If so, how many citizen scientists need to watch each video to get results equally as good as the results from the group of experts?
Statistical analysis of the beta test data for the first question consisted of chi-square analysis for the count data and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test analysis for the behavior and animal data. All of the analyses resulted in insignificant p-values (p=0.05), thus indicating no statistical difference between the data provided by the citizen scientists and the data provided by the experts. This told us that, yes, a group of citizen scientists can code the videos as accurately as a group of bat researchers.
Determining the answer to the second question was more difficult and required some innovative statistical analysis. One thousand random subsamples of size n were randomly generated from the total sample of citizen scientists. The appropriate analysis from the first question for each type of data (count, behavior, or animal) was run for the subsample. The results from the subsamples were compared to the results from the experts. If the p-value was still insignificant, then the subsample was reduced and the data were re-analyzed using the smaller sample size. This process continued until a significant p-value was obtained for each type of data.
When we first analyzed the data we took a very conservative approach. Our conservative approach showed that each behavior, animal, and count category needed a different minimum number of citizen scientists to observe the video in order to obtain results statistically the same as the experts in the beta test. The largest minimum number for any of the behaviors, animals, or count categories was 30 citizen scientists. However after thinking about the situation more, we decided that we were being too conservative. We then took a slightly different, but less conservative approach that is in some ways more realistic.
The new analysis of the beta test data indicated that an equal number of citizen scientists could produce as accurate data as an equal number of experts. We recognize this result is very different from our original analysis, but it makes sense conceptually. Most of the behaviors we are identifying are either very easy to identify or very hard to identify. The hard to identify behaviors are typically rare and happen very quickly. Seeing a single bat do a rare behavior that only takes a split second to occur often depends more on the observer paying attention to the “right bat” at the “right time” rather than the observer’s experience.
We are working on a detailed report and paper describing our statistical analysis of the data. We will post it here when it is completed.
As part of the beta test, the citizen scientists were asked to take a short survey that included questions about their level of expertise, attitudes about bats, and comments about the project. This survey helped inform the development of the full project. Overall, the report was very positive and many of the suggestions made by the participants were already being planned for the full project.
How to Use the Data
Researchers interested in studying lesser long-nosed bat behavior around a roost can use the data collected through Arizona BatWatch to focus on the specific behaviors they are most interested in studying. The videos are coded to also include general bat densities and other animals present to allow for studying potential correlations between those factors and bat behaviors.
Researchers can contact Shannon Trimboli, Arizona BatWatch team leader, to identify the video clips containing the behavior(s), bat densities, and/or other animals they are interested in studying. The researchers will still need to watch the identified video clips to conduct more in-depth analysis such as time budgets or correlations between behaviors, bat densities, or presence of other animals. However, this will require much less time than if the researcher had to watch and code the entire set of recorded videos without the help of the Arizona BatWatch participants.
The information provided with each requested video clip will include the video clip identification; date/time of recording; gate name; the behaviors, bat density, and other animals identified in the video clip; and the number of people indicating that each behavior, bat density, or other animal is present. All of the behaviors, bat densities, and other animals identified by participants are included. This system increases the likelihood of false positives, but that is preferable to having false negatives.
The number of people indicating the presence of a behavior, bat density, or other animal may help identify potential false positives. However, participant agreement should only be used as a rough guide for identifying false positives. Some of the behaviors are rare and/or difficult to identify even for the bat researchers who participated in the beta test. These are the behaviors most likely to be present, but only identified by a few participants. Not including data for rare and difficult to identify behaviors solely based on low participant agreement could result in false negatives.
Each video also includes one second of overlap with the previous video and with the next video. This overlap could result in some duplication of data recorded. However, we felt a small amount of overlap was necessary to provide context for the video and to avoid potentially losing behaviors that occurred at the very beginning or end of a video clip."
218;Mapping Change;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/mapping-change/about/research;"Why build a biodiversity atlas?
The Earth’s climate is changing. Measuring any kind of change requires a baseline, a description of the way things were before conditions changed, or before the pace of change accelerated. In this case, the baseline is a map where animals, plants, and fungi occurred in the Midwest’s recent past. Museum collections are an invaluable source of this kind of baseline data.
In fact, the Bell Museum has more than four million specimens of wildlife, plants and fungi from the Mississippi and western Great Lakes region. However, most information on these specimens, including the locations where they were collected, is hand-written on labels that require transcription. By participating in Mapping Change, you’re making baseline data available and usable. The resulting biodiversity atlas (bellatlas.umn.edu) is available to the public as well as researchers, land managers, and conservation planners. The more complete these baseline maps are, the better we are able to measure, interpret, and plan for changes to climate and biodiversity.
How can you help map change?
Museum collections contain high quality records of where plants, animals, and fungi were distributed across our region in recent history. Specimens in the Bell Museum’s collections, for example, have been collected over the past 125 years. Many specimens were collected at times prior to the development and alteration of the land and therefore represent the way things were before extensive European settlement.
Historical distribution data allow us to learn more about what environmental conditions are suitable for different organisms. Combining knowledge of those suitable conditions (known as an organism’s fundamental niche) with predictions about how environmental conditions will change in the future, allow us to predict where organisms may occur in the future. For example, scientists at Audubon predict that by the 21st century, the summer range of Minnesota’s state bird, the iconic Common Loon, will shift north and will no longer include Minnesota. Furthermore, evidence that range shifts are already underway includes the Ruby-throated Hummingbird’s winter range.
Why focus on change in the midwestern US?
The upper midwest of North America is unique because it contains three of the world’s largest terrestrial ecosystems. The convergence of the eastern broadleaf forests, the prairies of the Great Plains, and the coniferous forests of Canada means that this region is characterized by a remarkable array of plant and animal species.
Many of these species are already at the extremes of their ranges, occurring close to where one ecosystem borders another, significantly different system. When we consider how ecosystems and species will respond to climate change, models indicate that change will happen fastest at the extremes of ranges. Documenting, predicting, and understanding those changes depends on accurate and complete records of species distribution.

The Milky Way Project (MWP) shows you images obtained using two space observatories—the Spitzer Space Telescope and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). What you see is actually the infrared light from deep within our Galaxy, the Milky Way. This is not what you would see with your eyes, even looking through a telescope. In fact, that is exactly why astronomers have collected so much infrared data in the past twenty years: the beautiful structures in these images reveal the ""invisible"" parts of the Milky Way — which is actually most of the Milky Way.
The bubbles and bow shocks we find see in these teach us about the life cycles of stars. Many of these structures have already been found — by previous studies, including the first version of the MWP. The first MWP was so successful that we are returning to search again in greater detail while expanding the search to new regions of the Galaxy. We're building up a comprehensive view of not only these bubbles and bow shocks, but our Galaxy as a whole.
As well as bubbles and bow shocks there are other objects hidden throughout these images, including star clusters and never-before-seen galaxies that lie far beyond our own Galaxy, hidden behind the stars and dust. If you see anything unusual in the images, make sure to mark it and give your best guess as to what it is. We hope to map out these objects and then use your discoveries to make future observations. You might even discover something we didn't expect, something truly extraordinary!
STARBIRTH, STELLAR WINDS, AND INTERSTELLAR DUST
Imagine holding a single grain of sand in your hand. Pretty small, right? Now shrink that grain of sand tenfold. This is roughly how big interstellar dust particles are — they're more like smoke particles than the dust particles we know here on Earth! Yet this incredibly tiny piece of material exists in such huge quantity in the universe that it has huge consequences. Dust one-tenth the size of a grain of sand is one of the key players in the process of star formation. Massive clouds of dust and gas are what collapse to begin to form stars.
The trouble is that this dust, composed of tiny silicon or graphite particles, behaves in unexpected ways. It appears to be able to survive near hot, massive stars, where the interstellar winds and radiation pressure should force this usually cold dust to heat up and scatter, or powerful shocks driven by stellar wind should shatter and destroy the dust grains.
Bubbles are interesting places — they mark the locations where radiation from newly formed massive stars is impacting on the surrounding cloud material. How do we know the bubbles indicate sites of active star formation? Because bubbles are made by hot stars, and hot stars are generally found dominating clusters containing several hundred to several thousand low-mass stars apiece! Hot stars also don't live long enough to move far from the clouds where they formed — usually. All this means that each bubble represents several hundred to several thousand very young stars. We can hence use the MWP bubble catalogues produced by you, our volunteers, to map star formation throughout the Milky Way, and even to measure how quickly our home Galaxy gives birth to new, baby stars!
Bow shocks form when interstellar gas and dust gets pushed away from a hot star by its incredibly powerful stellar wind (blowing at up to two thousand kilometers per second). If the star itself is moving quickly relative to the surrounding interstellar gas and dust, the stellar wind gets deformed into a bow shock, which looks something like the ""bow wave"" of a boat speeding across a lake. Dust trapped in the bow shock is heated by the star, so like bubbles, bow shocks glow in the infrared. Because bow shocks tend to form around ""runaway"" stars that are moving at 30 to 100 kilometers per second themselves, they help us identify hot stars that have ""escaped"" from the star forming regions (bubbles!) where they were born. We also plan to use these bow shocks to measure the strength of stellar winds, which is an extremely important quantity governing the life cycle of the hottest, most massive stars.

220;Camera CATalogue;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/panthera-research/camera-catalogue/about/research;"WHO IS PANTHERA?
Panthera is a global conservation organization founded in 2006 exclusively to preserve wild cats and their ecosystems. In 50 countries around the world, Panthera’s team of leading biologists, law enforcement experts, and wild cat advocates work with partners to develop innovative strategies based on the best available science to protect cheetahs, jaguars, leopards, lions, pumas, snow leopards and tigers and their vast landscapes.
WHY DO WE NEED YOUR HELP?
Camera CATalogue is part of an effort to monitor big cats at a large enough scale to assist wildlife management and conservation. At multiple sites across the globe, Panthera's scientists set up a suite of motion-activated camera-trap stations. Each station comprises two cameras, enabling us to photograph both flanks of an animal as it walks past the cameras. We can then distinguish individually identifiable species (e.g., leopard, cheetah, jaguar) by the unique spot patterns on their coats, and use statistical models (known as capture-recapture models) to assess how often an individual is photographed.
Combined with information on where individuals were photographed, these data generate a robust estimate of wild cat populations for each study site. By conducting camera-trapping surveys every year, we can track trends to gauge whether populations have increased, decreased, or remained stable.
Camera traps cannot differentiate between wild cats and other animals, so as you can imagine, this means our camera-traps generate a huge amount of photographs. This is why we need the assistance of citizen scientists like you to help identify and classify all the images we collect so we can better understand—and protect—wild cats across the globe.
TAKING CAMERA-TRAPPING TECHNOLOGY TO THE NEXT LEVEL
Observing animals in the wild has long been a fascination of scientists and wildlife enthusiasts, and recently our ability to peer into the secret world of wildlife has been greatly enhanced with the development of camera trap technology.
The camera trap has revolutionized the field of wildlife research and conservation, enabling scientists to collect evidence of rarely seen and often globally endangered species. Researchers use camera traps to document the presence and health of wildlife populations, particularly in the face of human threats like deforestation and poaching. The results of these studies inform the development of crucial conservation actions. Equally important, the stunning photos and videos collected are used to raise awareness about the plight of wild cats and other animals around the world.
Historically, mass-market remote cameras were designed for hunting and did not produce the quality required for research and conservation. In response, Panthera developed the PantheraCam, a camera trap created to survey elusive, low-density species.
With the rise of wildlife poaching and the bushmeat trade, Panthera is now developing and testing the PoacherCam, a hidden camera trap that uses an imaging algorithm to distinguish people from wildlife. Using cellular networks, the PoacherCam can instantly transmit images of people, such as poachers in protected areas, to law enforcement officials, who can respond and intercede potential poaching threats."
221;Understanding Animal Faces;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/pszmhk/understanding-animal-faces/about/research;"Background on Understanding Animal Faces
Face perception refers to an individual's understanding and interpretation of the face. It has been an important research topic in both Psychology and Artificial Intelligence. However, most of research effort has been put on understanding human faces. In stark contrast to most prior research, the aim of this project is to make a step forward in helping computers understand animal faces!
To this end, this project aims to build an annotated database of animal faces which comprises hundreds of different animal species including American bulldogs, Bengal cats, Polar bears, Fallow deer, Ethiopian wolves, African leopards, and Mountain gorillas.
In the first phase of this project, we requested you to locate the face of the animal. In the second phase, we are asking you to annotate 9 landmarks on the animal face. Then, we will use the provided annotations to train Deep Neural Networks with the aim of training a computer to distinguish one species from the other based on facial information solely. In case you don't know, Deep Neural Networks is a recent breakthrough in Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to learn the structure of the visual world.
Impact
Training a computer to understand the structure of animal faces is a scientific achievement of huge significance per se. Besides this, our project has impact on a number of fields including animal health and welfare, species identification and animal-robot interaction!
Why your help is really needed
Our team is already putting a lot of time and effort in finding and selecting the animal facial images, but the real challenge in our project is the annotation of these images in terms of face location and facial landmarks.
In fact, it would be impossible to train a Deep Neural Network to understand animal faces without providing to it some guidance about the location and the structure of the animal face.
A single image might take between 15 and 30 seconds to annotate, and imagine that we need thousands of facial images of different species to train our Neural Network.
We hope that it becomes evident that without your help this project would not be feasible!"
222;Supernova Hunters;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/dwright04/supernova-hunters/about/research;"Supernova Hunters

The Crab Nebula (M1). This is thought to be the remnant of a supernova reported in 1054AD by Chinese astronomers. The supernova was so bright that it could be seen from Earth by the naked eye. The nebula is the gas thrown out be the supernova. At the centre of the nebula is a pulsar left behind by the supernova and which causes the gas to glow.
Supernovae are stars that explode with the energy of a few 10^27 atom bombs. We want to understand which stars explode and why. But it's probably not a good idea to try and setup an experiment to recreate the explosion on Earth (not that we could anyway)! Instead we must rely on our observations of supernovae to come up with theories that explain what we see. It turns out that there are many different types of supernovae and theories that try to explain each. These theories make predictions about the type of star that exploded or whether there is a nearby companion star and even the relative frequency of one type of supernova to another. These have implications for our understanding of how stars evolve and even explain how exotic objects like pulsars and blackholes form.
If a supernova doesn't match thoretical predictions, that makes it interesting. It suggests that we don't fully understand the underlying physics or maybe the explosion is caused by some other scenario that we haven't considered yet. These tend to be rare events and we have very little data that can help inform theory. The more common types of supernova are still important, we can use them to check that predictions of how often they should occur are correct and certain types can even be used to measure the expansion of the Universe.
With Supernova Hunters we aim to discover lots of new explosions and pass them on to the wider astronomical community. But finding supernovae isn't easy. We expect to observe about one supernova per galaxy every few centuries. So to find lots of supernovae we need to look at many galaxies at once. Pan-STARRS1 is great for this. Due to the large camera, the telescope has a field-of-view that covers about the same area as the full moon. This allows the telescope to scan large areas of the sky each night imaging many galaxies. Supernovae are also extremely bright and can out-shine all the other billions of stars that make up their galaxy. This means that we can discover distant supernovae even if we don't see the galaxy hosting the supernova.

In this example a star in the galaxy visible in the centre image explodes as a supernova. Despite the fact that this galaxy contains many billions of stars the supernova in the left image is many times brighter.
Searching for supernovae in this way produces vast amounts of data each night that we must sift through to find supernovae. We have software that tries to do this for us, but it produces many bogus detections of supernovae that must be filtered out by humans. Which is slow. With a small team of researchers data may not get filtered for a few days by which time the supernova could have reached peak.

This plot shows how the brightness of a supernova changes over time. Each point shows a Pan-STARRS1 observation. The x-axis is in units of days (MJD is just how astronomers count days) and the y-axis shows how bright the supernova was on each day. In this case we can't be sure when the supernova exploded or how bright it managed to get before it was discovered.
By helping us filter each nights data we can discover supernovae earlier. This allows us to alert other astronomers who can gather observations that cover the entire evolution of a supernova from explosion until it fades and disappears. We also hope to use your classifications to improve our algorithms and reduce the number of bogus detections that rely on human filtering.
Pan-STARRS1

Pan-STARRS stands for the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System. The 1 refers to the fact that the current telescope is the first of 4 planned. The Pan-STARRS1 telescope is a prototype developed at the University of Hawai'i's Institute for Astronomy. The design combines a relatively small mirror at 1.8m (the largest telescopes are currently about 10m) with a large digital camera with 1.4 gigapixels (GPC1). This produces a cost effective way to observe the entire sky visible from Hawai'i several times a month. Pan-STARRS1 was built with the primary goal of finding Near Earth Objects (NEOs), both asteroids and comets, which may pose a danger to earth. However, the survey also lends itself to looking for supernovae, rather than looking for objects that move we instead look for objects that suddenly appear.
During 2008 - 2014, the Pan-STARRS1 Surveys (PS1) were made possible through contributions of the
PS1 Science Consortium (PS1SC) composed of the Institute for Astronomy, the University of Hawaii, the Pan-STARRS Project Office, the Max-Planck Society and its participating institutes, the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, Heidelberg and the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, Garching, The Johns Hopkins University, Durham University, the University of Edinburgh, Queen's University Belfast, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network Incorporated, the National Central University of Taiwan, the Space Telescope Science Institute, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration under Grant No. NNX08AR22G issued through the Planetary Science Division of the NASA Science Mission Directorate, the National Science Foundation under Grant No. AST-1238877, the University of Maryland, and Eotvos Lorand University (ELTE). The PS1SC
have produced an all sky reference image, making it possible to find new supernovae.
PESSTO

Different transients discovered by Pan-STARRS1. Top: a supernova. Middle: a variable star Bottom: an Quasi Stellar Object (QSO).
From the Pan-STARRS1 discovery images in the figure above, it difficult to tell whether the source in the difference image (3rd column) is due to a supernova. There are many different types of stars that vary in brightness and as a result show up in our difference images. There are also Quasi Stellar Objects caused by matter falling onto supermassive blackholes at the centres of distant galaxies. In the difference images, detections of these real astrophysical sources all look like point sources of light. It is only by obtaining spectra that we begin to see differences (right most column above). Spectra measure how much light is emitted at each wavelength from a source. The examples above show that the different types are brighter at some wavelengths than others which makes them easy to distinguish. This is also the case for distinguishing between different supernova types.
The Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO) aims to confirm discoveries as supernovae and then continue to follow the supernova throughout its evolution. With PESSTO data we can study how the light emitted at each wavelength changes overtime. We will be feeding potential supernovae from Supernova Hunters directly to the PESSTO team. If PESSTO observes these supernovae the classification will be publicly announced in Astronomer's Telegrams (ATels). So far PESSTO has obtained spectra for 757 potential supernovae and has gathered data sets that span the evolution of 190 supernovae."
223;Decoding the Civil War;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/decoding-the-civil-war/about/research;"Statement of Purpose
Over one hundred and fifty years have passed since the end of the United States Civil War and it still captures the imagination and passion of young and old. The war and its participants — the policy makers, the generals, and the everyday troops and citizens — are perpetually fascinating to members of the public. Drawing together the expertise of three organizations — The Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens; North Carolina State University; and Zooniverse — along with a two-year grant from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC), Decoding the Civil War's goal is to use the transcription and decoding of Civil War telegrams from The Thomas T. Eckert Papers to harness this fascination and engage new and younger audiences using crowdsourcing technology to spark their curiosity and develop new critical thinking skills.
The transcription and decoding will contribute to national research, as each participant will become a “citizen archivist,” creating materials that will be of use and openly available to scholars interested in telegraphy, cryptography, communications during wartime, technology, civilian-military relations, and many other aspects of the Civil War or American history more generally. Perhaps the most meaningful outcome is that the collaborative will provide public access to previously unavailable historical records in a format that will lead to a better understanding of communications, technology, and the course of the Civil War.
The purpose of the project is three fold:
to provide open source access to a large, rare collection of 15,971 Civil War telegrams in The Thomas T. Eckert Papers that are owned by The Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens by digitizing all the telegram ledgers and code books;
to engage “citizen archivists” to crowdsource transcriptions and decode the telegrams with greater efficiency and accuracy than could be done by staff at participating institutions; and
to provide inquiry-based educational modules using the transcriptions to bring history alive to classroom students.
The outcomes of this project will be made available through:
This site, a web-based interface developed by Zooniverse to provide access to images of each telegram in the Eckert Papers and to encourage the public to transcribe the telegrams and decode those that are partially enciphered (this interface will be maintained after completion of the project);
The Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens, through the Huntington Digital Library and educational modules, providing unlimited and perpetual access to the digital images and transcriptions for scholars, students, and the public at large."
224;Pattern Perception;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/jukoch/pattern-perception/about/research;"Thank you for your interest in my research
In this section we will try to explain how your visual perception, that allows you to classify similarity and dissimilarity between spatial patterns, will help the hydrological modelling community to get a better understand of their models.
Background:
I am a PhD student at the University of Copenhagen and my research project focusses on the modelling of the hydrological cycle. In particular, I am interested in spatial patterns of hydrological processes at the land-surface, such as evapotranspiration or soil moisture. The spatial output of a hydrological model is a valuable source of information for environmental decision making. In order to obtain a good simulation of the spatial variability of a river system satellite remote sensing observations can be incorporated in the modelling process as (1) input data to drive the model or as (2) validation data to check the spatial performance of the model. My PhD topic focuses on the latter by exploring new possibilities to include spatial data in the validation of hydrological models. Along these lines, it is of high importance to quantify the spatial performance of a model with respect to a spatial observation. Here, statistical measures can be applied, but an automatized pattern comparison based on computer algorithms is not very trivial. Therefore we want to consult the human perception, which is a well trained and reliable measure for the comparison of patterns.
Abstract:
We want to identify the most important model inputs that drive the simulated spatial patterns of three essential hydrological variables: daily evapotranspiration, daily land-surface-temperature and daily land-surface-temperature rise (daytime-nighttime) in a state-of-the art hydrological model. For this purpose, we set up a test that is based on a hydrological model of a river in Denmark with the aim to find out which model inputs are most important to simulate the patterns of the above mentioned variables. In this experiment we built a reference model that is based on very detailed spatial model inputs. In six scenarios we move a step back and reduce the spatial detail of model inputs of vegetation, climate , rainfall and soil characteristics. In the following the zooniverse volunteers help to identify the scenarios that are most similar and dissimilar to the reference model. Scenarios that are classified as dissimilar by the visual perception of the volunteers can be considered as an important driver, because a spatial modification in the input alters the spatial output. Vice versa, scenarios rated as very similar are interpreted to be unimportant. The degree of importance is referred to as sensitivity. The sensitivity of the six scenarios to the three variables is evaluated for every third day in a period of three years (2008-1010). Thus seasonal variability and differences between years can be assessed as well.
The Catchment:
The maps in this study show the Skjern river catchment which is located in western Jutland, Denmark. Since 2007 this catchment has been subject to continuous monitoring activities and modelling work by the HOBE project. The catchment size is approximately 2400 square kilometres with climate conditions characterized as humid, cold temperate and oceanic with a mean annual precipitation of 990mm and mean annual temperature of 8°C. The major land use is agriculture followed by grassland, forest , heath and urban dominated areas. Hydrological data, such as river discharge, evapotranspiration, precipitation or soil moisture are measured at multiple sites across the catchment and are supported by satellite remote sensing data to get a detailed insight into all relevant hydrological processes taking place at various spatial scales. The scientific work carried out at this research catchment will contribute to a better understanding of potential hydrological consequences caused by natural and anthropogenic changes.

Spatial Sensitivity Analysis:
We developed six scenarios for the sensitivity analysis with the aim to identify the most important drivers of spatial variability of three hydrological variables: daily evapotranspiration, daily land-surface-temperature and daily land-surface-temperature rise (daytime-nighttime). The figure below introduces the six scenarios. The scenarios affect different kinds of input data which are all very typical inputs of hydrological models.
Below you see an example of the simulated spatial patterns of land-surface-temperature rise. The reference map in the centre is the baseline model with full spatial detail in its inputs. Map 1 to Map 6 originate from the six scenarios and the volunteers are asked to follow their well trained visual perception to mark the maps which they find are most similar to the reference. The map numbers are not linked to the scenarios and are randomly shuffled for each image. In this example a volunteer may select Map 2 as most similar to the reference map which would mean that the scenario that lies behind Map 2 can be regarded as insensitive in comparison to the other scenarios. On the other hand, Map 4 has a very different spatial pattern with respect to the reference pattern. Therefore the scenario behind Map 4 can be rated as sensitive.
The Variables:
You will assess the spatial patterns of three important hydrological variables at the land-surface: daily evapotranspiration, daily land-surface-temperature and daily land-surface-temperature rise (daytime-nighttime). Below you find a brief introduction to what the variables represent.
Evapotranspiration
Evapotranspiration (ET) is the sum of plant transpiration and evaporation from the land-surface and is typically measured in mm of water column per time unit. In Denmark, ET is typically highest in the summer months where the vegetation is most active due to the annual peak of the available energy.
Land-surface-temperature
Land-surface-temperature (LST) is another main variable that reflects the water and energy cycle at the land-surface. Unlike air temperature, it is directly linked to the hydrological processes taking place and the energy partitioning. Generally, a wet surface will show lower LST due to evaporative cooling whereas a dry surface will be characterised by a higher LST, because the incoming energy will be used to heat up the surface instead.
Land-surface-temperature-rise
Land-surface-temperature-rise (LSTr) describes the increase in LST (°C) between the early morning (6 am) and midday (12 pm). It quantifies the heating rate of the land-surface, is closely linked to the hydrological conditions. For instance, a well vegetated and wet surface will use most of the incoming energy for ET, which will result in a low heating of the surface between nighttime and daytime. Opposed, a high LSTr will occur if the surface is rather dry, then a larger part of the incoming energy will be used to heat up the surface and little for ET.
I hope you enjoy participating in this project!

225;Western Shield — Camera Watch;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/birgus2/western-shield-camera-watch/about/research;"Western Shield is a government funded conservation project that is dedicated to managing introduced predators, primarily foxes and cats, that threaten native wildlife in Western Australia. The program has been in operation in Western Australia since 1996 and in that period the program has been largely responsible for the recovery and return of a number of Western Australia's small to medium size mammals and birds. Species that have benefited from the program include the woylie, quenda, numbat and chuditch. However, although Western Shield has been successful in controlling foxes, foxes continue to come into our unfenced but managed areas from surrounding lands. Cats also continue to be a problem but as yet we don’t know how big this problem may be.
Western Shield is committed to improving our management programs to ensure the ongoing survival of our precious wildlife. As such, it is important to the program to understand if our management is successful and where it may not be working. Monitoring the numbers of predators and native species in different areas is good way to see how populations respond to management. In order to implement adaptive management it is vital we understand how the fox and cat populations respond to management and also to understand if the native species we are trying to protect are flourishing or failing.
Western Shield have therefore set up automated wildlife cameras in forest areas which are managed to control foxes and in areas which have never had any fox or cat control (treatments). Comparing the number of sightings of cats, foxes and native wildlife in these two different treatments will help us to understand the impact of our current baiting program. We may also be able to see how quickly foxes and cats return to an area after baiting. By watching the native animals we also get an understanding of what species survive with foxes and cats still in the area.
We currently manage foxes over an area encompassing 3.8 million hectares of Western Australia, incorporating land from the South-coast, right through to the Pilbara to the north. The images you see come from a very small area of the state's south west (outlined in blue in the map). Ideally we want to be able to monitor introduced predators from across the state but we are still trying to work out what methods are going to work best in each habitat type. With the information we collect from this site and other similar projects in different locations we hope to refine our monitoring methods to ensure we understand how fox and cat management is working. We can then use this information to adapt our management where necessary and ensure our native species thrive. As such it is likely the project will evolve and we hope the volunteers on Zooniverse can help us along the way."
226;Microscopy Masters;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/jbrugg/microscopy-masters/about/research;"Cryo electron microscopy, or cryo-EM, is a fast-growing field in structural biology. By freezing biological samples in ice and viewing them through an electron microscope, scientists can construct models of proteins and viruses that were impossible to image with previous methods. Through the collection and processing of thousands of images, some structures are even approaching atomic resolution, meaning they are able to discern individual atom structures within proteins. Before any of these exciting results can be achieved a number of steps have to be taken, some of which are quite tedious. Currently most cryo-EM scientists utilize an automatic program for picking individual proteins out of microscope images. However, there is ample reason to believe that these programs produce erroneous results and miss many usable protein particles. We hope to utilize the power of the human eye to better pick particles, in this case picking proteasome lid proteins from micrographs taken with one of the most powerful electron microscopes available.
Here's a short video introduction to Cryo-EM if you're interested in the whole process:
Your contributions
So, why do you we need you? Reconstructing a protein is a highly sensitive process, any particles that are incorrectly marked can cause mistakes in the final reconstruction. Automatic pickers are notorious for mistaking noise for particles. In addition, they can often miss valid particles, not properly pick out the center of a particle, or, depending on their methods, introduce bias into the dataset. We hope that by showing these images to unbiased citizen scientists, we can create better datasets and, by extension, more detailed models of proteins and other biomolecules.
Our Data
The primary dataset used in this project was collected by Dr. Corey Dambacher, working in the lab of Dr. Gabriel Lander at The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, CA. They are interested in studying the proteasome, a large complex important in protein degradation. It can be thought of a big recycling center, which takes unwanted proteins from the cell and breaks the peptide bonds between individual amino acids and releases them back into the cell. The proteasome is a very large protein complex, with many component parts making up the whole structure. Our current data are of the ""lid"" complex, which is crucial for making sure the correct proteins are brought into the proteasome, and that they are correctly oriented. Knowing the structure of the lid will help us better understand how our cells degrade proteins and control protein concentrations.
Below we have the full proteasome on the left, and the lid on the right.

The main aim of this study is to complete the most massive statistical survey of galactic warp with ~ 10,000 samples. To do so, we need to measure the amplitude of warped structure and classify the type of warp by visual investigation.
[1] Select the Type of Warp
We classified warped galaxies into THREE different morphological types, based on the warp directions of both sides of the disk. If the both end points of disk are warped in the opposite direction like an integral shape, then we considered the galaxy as S-type, while if it is warped in the same direction like a bowl-like shape, it is dubbed as U-type. Also if the galaxy is warped toward only one side, we classified it as L-type. In addition, if there are not detectable warped structure on both sides, then just regard those galaxies as no-warped galaxies.
[2] Measure the Warp Angle

The figure above illustrates the definition of the warp angles. The warp angle A is defined as the angle between the major axis of the galaxy and the end point of warped disk, and the secondary angle B is defined as the angle between the major axis and the starting point of warped disk. According to this simple definition, the warp angle are measured in both sides of each galaxy.
In order to measure the warp angle precisely, we need to point out the ""Elbow"" points of galaxies. We provide the optical images of each galaxy. The center of galaxy is defined based on the luminosity distribution automatically. At first, you only need to point out the point, where the galaxy begin to bend, and after then point out where the galactic disk is finished. And repeat on other side. Through these very simple process, you can help astronomers investigate the warp structure of disk galaxies.

Opening new doors to our understanding of whales: Today, whales and dolphins are legally protected from exploitation in most countries. But they were hunted for centuries, hunted with rapacious intensity from the early 1900's to the 1970’s. This left a world of oceans nearly empty of their largest inhabitants. How are they recovering? What has changed as a result? With climate change and ever increasing competition for ocean resources, will they be able to return to their former abundance?
Snapshots at Sea opens a novel approach to answering these and many more questions; with your help we can find and identify whales and other marine mammals in mass volumes of images from scientists, naturalists and public contributors. The images here come to us via Happywhale.com, where we ask photographers worldwide to put forward images to extract their scientific value. ‘Opportunistic’ data like this accounts for the majority of whale sightings worldwide. What have we found? In it’s pilot season, our work in Antarctica has already found a kind of killer whale (so called ‘Type D’) that had only previously been seen 14 times in history. We have also found re-sightings of known humpback whales, identified to individuals by comparing against whales seen in years past. As Snapshots at Sea continues we are documenting little known populations, such as the whales of the southern hemisphere where an incomprehensible 3,000,000 whales were killed last century. And we are providing unprecedented resolution into the activities of whales in better studied areas like coastal California.
The Collaborative Filtering Process
Each question in Snapshots at Sea is one step in a filtering process where we turn large volumes of images into usable scientific data. These images contain identifiable individuals, can show behavior, and can tell us who each whale associates with. Since we know where and when these photos were taken, once we know who is in the photos we can reconstruct population trends, migration patterns and social structures. We have developed a decision process of yes/no questions to cut through the challenge of interpreting these volumes of information, and to find the gems within the mass of images we receive. Each image will follow a path dependent on its content. For example, to identify an individual whale, we use distinctive shapes and markings on the dorsal fin or underside of the tail (the fluke). The path of a single humpback whale photo to be identified by the fluke would be:
Is there at least one animal in this photo? YES
Are there whales or dolphins in this photo? YES
Is there more than one whale or dolphin in this photo? NO
Is there a dorsal fin in this photo? NO
Is there a fluke (tail) in this photo? YES
Is this fluke a Humpback Whale? YES
We will then send this photo to our Whales as Individuals Zooniverse project to prep it for automated identification, with hopes of finding out who the whale is .
The reason we call this ""collaborative filtering"" is because ultimately we hope to develop machine learning algorithms to integrate at each step along the way -- so humans (you guys) would be collaborating with machines to filter down this large dataset one small step at a time. Whereas correctly identifying which species is in a photo from a dozen choices, it's easier (we hope) for computers to answer each small question separately. If we're ultimately able to integrate computers as a sort of first step, we'll be much more efficient and get through many, many more photos.
The Team
Snapshots at Sea is a collaboration between Animal.us (creators of Happywhale.com), Cascadia Research Collective, and College of the Atlantic's Allied Whale.
Animal.us is a Public Benefits Corporation developing Happywhale.com with the mission of enabling people to recognize, connect with and follow individual animals to further science and create a rich understanding of wild species.
Cascadia Research Collective is a tax-exempt non-profit research organization founded in 1979 that has coordinated the long term photo-ID efforts on blue, humpback, and gray whales on the US West Coast since the mid 1980s. More recently, photo-ID efforts have expanded to include fin whales, Risso’s dolphins and Cuvier’s beaked whales. See www.cascadiaresearch.org for more information.
One of the major subjects for Snapshots at Sea are the melon-headed whales of Hawaii, researched by Dr. Robin Baird of Cascadia Research. Please see: Hawaii page and melon-headed whale page. View an Ocean Mysteries documentary about whale research in Hawaii.
Allied Whale, the whale science group at College of the Atlantic, was founded in 1972 and houses the largest collection of information on photo-identified humpback and finback whales in the world. Photo-ID is a technique that enables scientists to follow an individual whale anywhere it may travel throughout its life by comparing natural color patterns, fin shapes, and other distinguishing marks that appear in its photographs. Allied Whale researchers were among the first to successfully use this technique to study whales. See www.coa.edu/allied-whale for more information."
229;Comet Hunters;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/mschwamb/comet-hunters/about/research;"Welcome to Comet Hunters
Main-belt comets are a recently discovered population of small bodies residing in the Solar System's asteroid belt exhibiting distinctive tails that we typically associate with comets. Very little is known about main-belt comets as only a handful (about 10) have been discovered to date, but with a larger sample we could probe the origins of the Solar System and the active processes occurring in today's asteroid belt.

We have initiated the Comet Hunters project to try to greatly increase the discovery rate of these objects. Some main-belt comets were first known as inactive main-belt asteroids, and then were only found to have cometary activity in later observations. Asteroids frequently appear by chance in wide-field astronomical observations, and so by scanning through these images, we may have a chance of finding more active objects. We have extracted images of known main-belt asteroids from the public archives of the Subaru Telescope, one of the largest telescopes in the world (at 8.2 meters, or 27 feet, across), located on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. None of the objects we are targeting have been previously known to show activity, but most have so far only previously been studied using small telescopes that may have missed faint activity.

This is important because we believe we can discover many more main-belt asteroids if we can detect fainter activity, and the way to detect fainter activity is to use larger telescopes like Subaru. Detecting comet-like activity is not easy. Comets can have a wide variety of appearances, and it is difficult to design automated routines to detect all the different types of cometary behavior that might exist in telescope images. In contrast, the human eye can easily spot tails of many different shapes and size that indicate cometary activity.

This is where you come in. By reviewing asteroid images on the Comet Hunters website to identify whether the asteroids has a tail or not, you can help find new candidate main-belt comets that the Comet Hunters science team will then follow up with ground- and space-based telescopes. Most of these chance asteroid observations have never been reviewed for cometary activity before. You just might be the first to discover that an asteroid is really a comet!
Asteroids and Comets
Asteroids and comets are small bodies (several hundred miles across, or less) leftover after the construction of our Solar System's planets. Asteroids are commonly assumed to be mostly rocky or metallic, while comets are a mixture of rock, dust, and ice. As a result of their icy composition, when comets come close to the Sun and get hotter, they become ""active"" as their ice sublimates (changes from solid to gas), releasing gas and dust, creating the distinctive fuzzy halo (known as a coma) and tails that we associate with comets.

The different compositions of asteroids and comets are due to these objects' different origins and present-day locations. Asteroids are mostly found in the main asteroid belt (also known as ""the main belt"" or ""the asteroid belt"") on circular orbits between Mars and Jupiter. Asteroids orbit relatively close to the Sun in a region where it is expected in the present-day Solar System that frozen ice would have have little chance of survival on the surfaces and interiors of small bodies. On the other hand, comets were mostly assumed to have come from the outer Solar System, in the Kuiper Belt or Oort Cloud, beyond the orbit of Neptune, where temperatures are much colder and thus much easier for an icy object to stay that way. Comets typically have elongated orbits where they only spend a short amount of time near the Sun before heading back to the cold outer Solar System, allowing them to preserve their ice content. Asteroids were thought to remain inactive at all times, given their assumed lack of ice, but this changed with the the discovery of the first main-belt comets in 2006.
Activity in the Asteroid Belt
The assumed clear distinctions between comets and asteroids was seriously challenged in 2006 with the discovery of main-belt comets, which orbit in the main asteroid belt but have been observed showing cometary activity (including coma and dust tails) determined to be due to the excavation of subsurface ice which then sublimates when it is heated by the Sun.

In 2010, the first of several currently known disrupted asteroids --- which also orbit in the main asteroid belt and show comet-like activity, except that their activity is not due to the sublimation of ice, but rather due to disruptive events, such as impacts ejecting dust into space, or spinning so fast that surface material is actually thrown into space from centrifugal forces --- was discovered. Disrupted asteroids can mimic MBCs, and so we need to do follow-up observations to distinguish between the two cases.

The discovery of inner Solar System objects (like the MBCs) that still contain enough ice to produce observable cometary activity is surprising. The presence of pristine frozen material probably dating back to the formation of our Solar System could give us the opportunity to learn more about how our Solar System formed, and perhaps provide insights into how planetary systems around other stars are born and evolve. It has also been hypothesized that a significant amount of Earth's present-day water may have been delivered by objects from the asteroid belt. By studying MBCs today, we may be studying a possible source of Earth's water, which of course was crucial to the rise of life. Meanwhile, studying disrupted asteroids as they are being disrupted allows us to better understand collisional and physical processes in the asteroid belt for which there are many theories but very few direct observations.
Where Does the Data Come From?
On Comet Hunters, you can either review images of asteroids from two different searches: the HSC (Hyper-Suprime-Cam) Survey Search or the Archival Data Search. HSC and Suprime-Cam (which is the camera that provided the images for the Archival Data Search) are optical cameras that pair with the Subaru Telescope located on Mauna Kea in Hawaii.
In the HSC Survey Search, you will be looking at data from a currently running multi-year survey using Hyper-Suprime-Cam, meaning that all of the data will have been obtained relatively recently (all within the last few years). If the images were obtained very recently (i.e., within the last few months), this means that newly discovered comets might trigger an immediate campaign to obtain follow-up observations. On the other hand, data in the Archival Data Search may have been obtained any time within the last 17 years (going back to 1999). However, we expect ""true"" main-belt comets (whose activity is due to sublimation like in ""regular"" comets) to show repeated activity when their orbits bring them back to within close proximity of the Sun. As such, if any comets are discovered in past data, we can simply wait for them to reach the same part of their orbit in the future (they typically have orbit periods of 5-6 years), and then get follow-up observations at that time. Both approaches are equally valuable for scientists interested in main-belt comets.
Regardless of the slight differences, both datasets have never before been searched for cometary activity. You just may be the first one to know that an asteroid is really a comet in disguise.
Suprime-Cam
Suprime-Cam (Subaru Prime Focus Camera) was the first large wide-field camera on an 8-10-m optical telescope, the largest class of optical telescopes presently built in the world. The 80 megapixel and 10 CCD (charged-coupled device) camera was mounted at prime focus on the 8.2-m Subaru Telescope. The camera was arranged in 5x2 CCD pattern see below, enabling Suprime-Cam to cover in total 0.25 square degrees of the night-sky (equivalent to the size of the full Moon as viewed from Earth) in a single pointing. First light for Suprime-Cam was in July 1999, and the camera was active on Subaru until the end of 2015. Currently we've selected Suprime-Cam exposures that are ~60s long where most of the asteroids appear circular like the stars.

Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC)
Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) is one of the first next generation of wide-field cameras to mounted on the 8-10 optical ground-based telescopes. Paved with 104 science CCDs (charged-coupled devices), HSC rests at the the prime-focus of the Subaru Telescope. HSC covers a 1.5 degree diameter circle on the sky; ~8 times more area than in a single image from HSC's predecessor Suprime-Cam. In one pointing HSC can capture the full extent of the Andromeda Galaxy. Comet Hunters is currently supplied by HSC images from the HSC Subaru Strategic Program's (SSP) Wide Survey. These observations are 150-second long, and due to the motion of the asteroid across the sky, the asteroids will appear elongated (like an lima bean) compared to the backgrounds image stars in the HSC Comet Hunters search. The HSC SSP commenced in March of 2014 and observations are on-going.

Known Comet Snapshots
From time to time, we will insert some images of already known comets into the Comet Hunters classification interface that you might encounter. Although these are images of known comets, they are as important as finding new comets. By classifying these images you help us understand how sensitive as a whole Comet Hunters is to detecting different types of cometary behavior and varying tail shapes. That’s okay if you don't spot the object as having a tail. Some of the comets will have obvious tail; others will be much harder to tell if anything is there. We're not testing you, we're learning what types of comets we can and can't find with Comet Hunters.
If you encounter a known comet, we will in the future be able to identify that it was a known comet right after you classify directly in the interface. This is a feature that will be added to the Zooniverse platform in the near future. In the meantime, we will label all known comets with the #knowncomet hashtag on Comet Hunters Talk (click on the 'Talk' button after you classify. The reason we don’t identify the known comet first, is that if you knew, you might answer differently when reviewing the images. To be able to use the data from the previous known comet images accurately, we need them to be examined in exactly the same manner as the Subaru asteroid data.

230;Jungle Rhythms;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/khufkens/jungle-rhythms/about/research;"The rhythm of plant life
Recurring life cycle events (or phenology) of plants, such as yearly flowering, seed dispersal, and leaf shedding are key to understand plant functioning. These events provide us with information on, for example, dispersal potential and growth responses in a changing climate. Consistent long-term observations have regularly been collected in temperate regions (outside the tropics). Most of these observations have been colllected by enthusiast naturalists, researchers as well as citizen scientists. However, observing life cycle events of tropical plant species is particularly difficult. The dense impenetrable nature of tropical forests, and their remote location, makes observing the life cycle of these plants very challenging. Yet, gathering and interpreting the life cycle events of tropical plant species is key to understanding the future of tropical forests in a changing world.
Life cycle events and climate feedbacks
The African rainforest, the second largest on Earth, covers ~630 million ha and stores up to 66 Pg of carbon. It is presently a persistent carbon sink, offsetting large amounts of human CO2 emissions. Drought events in tropical rainforests have a strong potential to alter forest structure and function. However, due to data scarcity, little is known on how droughts affect the structure and function of African rainforests. In this project we will try to link long term observations of tree life cycle events with weather data. This will allow us to track the trees' responses to variation in rainfall and temperature. This data may provide us with key information on how sensitive tree species are to drought, and how this sensitivity might alter the structure and function of the forest as drought regimes change.

Historical observations
From 1937 - 1958 scientists stationed at the Yangambi research station in the Republic of the Congo (then Belgian Congo) made an effort to observe more than 2000 trees on a weekly basis, writing down key life cycle events, e.g. fruit development, flowering and leaf shedding. All of these weekly observations were jotted down in little notebooks and finally summarized in large hand-drawn tables (figure below and FAQ). In an effort to recover the key parts of this knowledge, which currently only exists on paper, and preserve the original copy, Jungle Rhythms will transcribe the summary tables.

A Summary Table
Why appeal to citizen scientists?
The nature of the notation used, mainly using fine hand-drawn pencil lines overlaying another fine gray line, make it really hard to process these images automatically. The human eye and brain is finely tuned to finding patterns and picking up these slight nuances in shading. Participants also have background knowledge of the project, and this contextual information further helps in understanding the notes. Participants are presented with yearly sections and are be asked to annotated features within the section. At the end of the project annotations will be combined into a timeline of each trees' life cycle events and matched with weather data. Below you see an example section of the larger table (above) with different hand-drawn pencil lines and text we want to transcribe.

Detail of Hand-drawn Pencil Marks
Who made the observations? And why?
All we currently know is that these observations were made by research scientists at the Yangambi agricultural research station between 1937 - 1958. During our efforts to digitize the data, we did not come across any mention of names associated with project. The age of the data set would also make it very unlikely that observers are still alive today. We do know that some of the observations were made along the roads in and around Yangambi, as we found evidence of maps referencing the number associated with each specimen. We assume that a fair amount of the observations were made in a research forest nearby. It also remains a mystery why the observations were made. As the research station was focused on agriculture and forestry, we assume that the researchers at the time might have wanted to understand the life cycle events of a trees better in order to optimize forestry practices.
As participants work on Jungle Rhythms, we will try to trace some of the data's historic context. Looking through archives might not only provide context, but also additional data. We already posses the climate data as measured at the research station, which is key to understanding the life cycle events. We know that a similar dataset was collected at the botanical research forest in Luki on the Atlantic side of DR Congo. The two forests differ significantly in weather patterns. The existence of coordinated observations confirms that this was a deliberate experimental design, so we believe a motivation and clear description of the methods used should have been documented.

Shakespeare's World invited volunteers to explore what it was like to live, work, or raise a family in early modern England. The project featured three genres of material over four years: letters, ‘receipt’ (recipe) books, and newsletters--early handwritten news sheets.
The project was a collaboration between the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C., Zooniverse.org at Oxford University, and the Oxford English Dictionary of Oxford University Press. The project invited people to transcribe manuscripts created by thousands of men and women who were alive in and around Shakespeare’s lifetime, 1564–1616. The goals of the project were to transcribe early modern manuscripts in order to facilitate the discovery of texts in the Folger digitized collections; to create a body of early modern transcriptions that could be used for humanities research at scale; and to identify new words and word variants not represented in the OED. The project has succeeded in its goals, and the data is being used by various researchers. Nearly 6,000 pages are available on Luna, the Folger's website.

232;Fossil Finder;paused;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/adrianevans/fossil-finder/about/research;"Helping with the search and classification of fossils
The University of Bradford has teamed up with the Turkana Basin Institute to bring FossilFinder.org to you. We need your help and keen eye to assist in the identification of surface geology including fossils and cultural remains from the fossil bearing deposits at Lake Turkana in northern Kenya. Everybody involved will be a meaningful and valuable member of the team.
Why it is important?
Fossil Finder is about interpreting the environments of the past in which our human ancestors. Modern humans (you and I), are just the most recent species in a long evolutionary trail with many dead ends. Our ancestors existed alongside many other animals living by the swamps and rivers flowing into the ancestral Lake Turkana. This lake basin grew and shrank over past times and sediments preserved the bones of animals that lived here. By identifying the sandstones and snails, fossils and other features on the surface we can piece together the palaeoenvironment going back in time. We traditionally do this by sending teams of fossil hunters out on foot to these same areas that are captured in these images. You can help the team document the features in these images in more detail than we would normally document. If you find something of great significance in these images, the ground team can get back to the exact place and collect it following the collection procedures.
Why Lake Turkana?
There are numerous fossil sites throughout the Great Rift Valley. As water flows down in rivers from the highlands either side it forms numerous lake basins, which gradually accumulate sediment. These conditions preserve the remains of animals that lived here in the past. These older sediments are brought up to the surface through tectonic movements in the rift through faulting and uplift. Gradual erosion of these surfaces exposes fossil and geological artifacts. The Lake Turkana Basin is one such lake basin in the East African Rift Valley and is particularly rich in fossil deposits going back 6 million years. Recently the oldest stone tools were revealed from deposits on the west side of Lake Turkana, dated to 3.3 million years. There are many amazing new finds being discovered in the east African rift valley systems, including this recent example from Ethiopia.
What the data will tell us?
A long term and valuable research return from the data will be an interpretation of the surface geology of the sediments, some of which contain fossils and artefacts. This will allow us to supplement the citizen science search with a more targeted ‘boots on the ground’ approach. There is also the possibility that interesting specimens will be found in our images. Due to methods used to collect our data, our images are all georeferenced and therefore we will be able to get back to those finds.
How FossilFinder began
We began our research project with broad aims in using modern digital technologies to transform scientific research in the arts and humanities. As part of this we thought about landscapes and survey methods. We were conscious of the amount of person hours that are required to capture paleoenvironmental data in detail from the survey areas and aimed to think of ways we might enhance this using digital technologies. We proceeded to develop aerial imaging platforms that can capture ground surface images at high enough resolution to be able to see fossil fragments and other important paleontological and archaeological artefacts. With this imagery we are able to recreate the experience of a fossil hunter walking over these ancient landscapes and we could potentially engage an army of citizen scientists to help us with this task.
Fossil Finder forms part of the Arts and Humanities Research Council funded Fragmented Heritage Project."

This project aims to rapidly assess pre- and post-event satellite imagery, in order to produce a heat map of urgent priorities for teams involved in early recovery efforts. UK Disaster Risk Reduction and Response charity Rescue Global is deploying a team to The Bahamas to collect data on the ground. In partnership with the University of Oxford, the Planetary Response Network and Zooniverse, Rescue Global would like to obtain crowd-sourced ""heat map"" data of priorities from the Zooniverse community, to support their own aerial and ground reconnaissance.
We are asking volunteers to compare pre- and post-event satellite images at in order to identify the effects of the hurricane. The data analysis team will combine this with publicly available mapping and assessment data from other efforts such as those underway from the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team and Tomnod to provide high-quality information to Rescue Global.
As the situation evolves and the needs of responders and decision-makers evolve, this project will likely evolve too. Please check Talk for the most up-to-date information. Thank you."

Hawk Talk is a new project of the Bird Cams Lab from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, funded by the National Science Foundation. Even though Red-tailed Hawks are one of the most widespread North American birds, scientists still have so much to discover about their behavior and vocalizations.
Hawk Talk is also a research investigation that is co-created by cam viewers and scientists. During the summer of 2018, a group of volunteer cam watchers spent weeks observing the Red-tailed Hawk cam, brainstorming questions about what they were seeing, and ultimately voting on a question to investigate:
Do hawks use different kinds of calls in different situations at the nest?
Previous researchers that have documented Red-tailed vocalizations have been mostly limited to what they can hear on the ground or when briefly checking a nest. The 24/7 Red-tailed Hawk cam gives us the chance to document vocalizations right at the nest for the entire season without disturbing the birds!

Throughout the year we operate several bird feeder cameras spread in various locales, and we're interested in going beyond simply counting birds at feeders. We want to try and understand more about the behavior of the birds that visit—a task that video is uniquely suited for. More specifically we want to answer the question, How does diversity (number of species) and abundance (number of individuals) affect behavioral interactions (specifically displacements) at a feeder? With your help, we can better understand the social dynamics at a bird feeder as well as how these dynamics may shift when conditions change (e.g. weather).
This Zooniverse project seeks to leverage the interest we've seen from viewers watching our Bird Cams to participate more in sharing what they see and learning about the birds they're seeing on-screen. This means that while we there is a main research question, that doesn't mean other questions can't be answered! This project can be shaped by you, the community.

241;Where are my body organs?;finished;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/h-spiers/where-are-my-body-organs/about/research;"Why are we doing this research?
When the general population have to attend a GP appointment, Accident & Emergency, or any other healthcare visit they often describe pain or discomfort in a specific area, for instance stomach pain may be listed anywhere in the abdomen. The healthcare professional who diagnoses and treats you has studied anatomy and will know the structure(s) that are affected.
However, some members of the public know a large amount of anatomy. An example would be someone who spends time in a gym, might have familiarity with, for examples some muscles. This research intends to highlight exactly how much the general public know about their own body and thus utilise it, via publication as a research article(s), to illustrate the need for sound anatomical knowledge from medical professionals and to help everyone understand where many of the common organs and structures are in the body.
We also aim to highlight how anatomical knowledge is different across different groups of people, i.e is there a difference between males and females? If you have been to a visit a healthcare professional recently do you perform better, because you are more aware of structures? Does the knowledge of people change as they age?
We have undertaken preliminary research on this topic, which can be found [here]: (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ase.1746/abstract)
What our research goals?
We are aiming to undertake the largest project to date to understand the anatomical knowledge of the general public, we have a number of specific questions that we are looking to answer:
What is the extent of anatomical knowledge of the global population?
Are there any observable differences between the ages and gender of the respondents?
Will individuals that work in a health care facility/profession perform well?
Will individuals that recently (within a week) went for a consultation with a healthcare professional perform well?
Is there geographic/regional differences in performances?
Overall, we hope that our research will demonstrate that there is a varied level of knowledge within the public and that there are certain areas of anatomy that we can do more to educate everyone about in the hope that we will improve how people interact with healthcare services, to improve the outcome for all involved.

242;Galaxy Builder;finished;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/tingard/galaxy-builder/about/research;"Galaxy Builder
Galaxies are complicated. We need your help to build models of them.
This project lets you create a model of a galaxy image, which we can use learn about its structure, and how it assembled over cosmic time.
More than the sum of its parts
Galaxies can be broken down into multiple components. Most galaxies can be built with a bulge (a kiwi fruit-shaped bit) and a disc (shaped like a dinner plate). Many also have bars and spiral arms. Being able to separate the light from these different components will allow us to study the star formation history of each separately, as well as helping us understand the galaxy's dynamical history (such as any galaxy mergers it has been through).
For example, the presence of a ""classical"" bulge (one that's very centrally concentrated, and likely does not rotate) in a galaxy suggests that it has undergone some kind of merger event, with the brightness of the bulge relative to the galaxy disc tied to the strength of the merger.
How do researchers analyse galaxy structure?
Previous Galaxy Zoo projects have produced a wealth of new science, but most have been limited to simple multiple-choice questions. To obtain precise mathematical descriptions of galaxy structure scientists make use of computer fitting algorithms to automatically find the best model for a given galaxy.
The problem with computational fitting is that when galaxies become complicated the computer struggles to find the best model, as it is generally just trying to maximise some goodness-of-fit statistic. This results in scientists having to check the results and often control things manually, which isn't scalable with the size of modern surveys. A recent study by Gao and Ho found that just performing a detailed structural analysis of only 10 galaxies was unfeasibly time-consuming using current tools. The 10 galaxies they looked at can be seen here:

Caption: Gao & Ho (2017), Figure 1
  One of the take-home messages from their paper was that it is important to properly model secondary (complicated) components, and future morphological analyses should attempt to take them into account.
This is where the strength of citizen science comes in: by letting you build models by hand you can come to decisions using previous experience and physical intuition about how the galaxy should be modelled, and by combining your answers with computer fits we'll be able to get much better results than either humans or a computer alone!

243;The Community Seagrass Initiative - Seagrass Explorer;finished;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/mark-dot-parry/the-community-seagrass-initiative-seagrass-explorer/about/research;"WHAT IS SEAGRASS AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
Seagrasses are the only group of true marine flowering plants, generally found in shallow sheltered tropical and temperate waters around the world. They create complex habitats in otherwise featureless, muddy and sandy seabeds, providing homes for a rich variety of species. Here in the UK, many seagrass beds can be found in sheltered bays, estuaries and rias. Seagrass beds have a root system under the sediment (rhizomes) and long slender leaves above, which create a ‘canopy’. The rhizome grows in length and sends up new shoots which are genetic clones of the original. Seagrass also reproduces sexually and creates pollen just like grasses on land.
Seagrass beds provide many benefits to people living in coastal communities - we call these ecosystem services. This important habitat has been recognised for its role in the life cycles of many commercial fisheries species, acting as a nursery ground for juveniles. It can also help sub tidal coastal areas by stabilising sediments, reducing coastal erosion, and improving water quality. More recently it has been recognised as being 40 times more effective at storing carbon than rainforest, helping reduce effects of global warming. It also releases large amounts of oxygen into the surrounding seas improving water quality for other species.
THREATS TO THIS VITAL HABITAT
Due to coastal development and physical pressures, this fragile habitat faces many threats around the world including:
Poor water quality - pollutants and excess nutrients which cause algal blooms
Invasive species from abroad- competing for light and space
Disease
Increased recreational water use over the habitat
Lack of local knowledge about its location and importance
In 2014, it was found that seagrass is one of the most rapidly declining ecosystems on Earth- with 7% of its known area disappearing every year (source: 11th International Seagrass Biology Workshop, 2014). In the UK, seagrass beds have been identified as threatened nationally and in need of conservation so have therefore been classed as a Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) habitat. Many of the seagrass beds we will survey throughout this project also have other conservation designations such as Marine Conservation Zone, Special Area of Conservation and Site of Special Scientific Interest. All of which are designed to stop the degradation of these important habitats and the animals that live there. This priority habitat is home to many rare, exciting and protected species such as both species of UK seahorse, fan mussels and stalked jellyfish.
However, despite awareness of the importance of these habitats they are in decline globaly; more work is needs to protect and preserve them. This is where the Community Seagrass Initiative aims to help.
HOW YOU CAN HELP
Check Out Commercial Fish Species
As part of our surveying strategy we deploy a baited underwater camera to try and attract and capture photos of mobile animals that live within the seagrass beds. The camera captures time lapse photos and these are what we need your help to analyse as part of the Zooniverse Seagrass Explorer. Seagrass is known for its vital role in the life cycles of many commercially important fisheries species and the results we gain from the Seagrass Explorer will allow us to find out which species are present where and estimate abundance of these different animals.
Dive Into Seagrass Density
You can also help us to monitor the density of seagrass in the meadows growing across the project area. This will give us an understanding of how healthy they are and how they change seasonally and over longer time scales. In this workflow we'd also like you to look out for any seaweed (algae) and animals present. Algae is very fast growing and can compete with seagrass plants for light and space. Learning more about whether algae and other animals are present and how commonly they are seen will show us if there is any relationship between seagrass health and the animals and algae that are present there.
ABOUT THE PROJECT
The Community Seagrass Initiative (CSI) is a citizen science project led by the National Marine Aquarium and contributing partners, and kindly funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund. The project will involve participants in citizen science - volunteers will gather information, subsequently contributing a greater scientific understanding of the heritage.
The CSI will cover 19 subtidal seagrass beds in five regions along the 191 mile stretch of coastline from Looe in Cornwall to Ringstead, just East of Weymouth in Dorset. Surveying activities will be based around 5 centres: Looe (1 seagrass bed), Plymouth (7 seagrass beds), Salcombe (1 seagrass bed), Torbay (5 seagrass beds) and Weymouth (5 seagrass beds).
Project Goals
Engagement - Increase knowledge, influence attitudes and modify behaviours of a varied audience on the importance of seagrass communities and the individuals role in the protection of this vital element of our natural heritage.
Action - Establish a long term, volunteer led monitoring programme for seagrass habitats and Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) species across 19 seagrass locations in the South West, UK.
Conservation - Produce an evidence base to support future investment into new, practical conservation tools, to monitor the health of seagrass communities and protect them from human impacts.
CSI Team and Project Partners
The CSI project officers, who co-ordinate all aspects of the project, are: Project Manager Mark Parry based at the National Marine Aquarium in Plymouth, Rachel Cole based at Torbay Coast and Countryside Trust in Torbay and Jess Mead based at Weymouth SEALIFE Adventure Park.
Through the development process the CSI has received strong support from other conservation and scientific organisations, partners that will assist in the delivery of the CSI are:
National Marine Aquarium
Torbay Coast and Countryside Trust
Living Coasts
Weymouth SEALIFE Adventure Park
The project is also supported by, University of Plymouth Marine Institute, the Marine Biological Association, South Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Tamar Estuary Consultative Forum, Devon Wildlife Trust, Cornwall Wildlife Trust, Dorset Wildlife Trust, British and Irish Associations of Zoos and Aquaria, Marine Conservation Society - Seasearch and Looe Voluntary Marine Conservation Group.
Together, the partners, stakeholders and project officers aim to provide an engaging and exciting project for volunteers and members of the general public that offers the opportunity to learn more about their coastal environment."

Every day since 1860 the UK Met Office has produced daily weather reports from across western Europe. The observations came from Sweden in the north to Spain in the south, and from Ireland in the west to Germany in the east.
Originally the weather observations were transmitted by telegraph to London and collated. Most of the weather observations, especially from before 1950, have never been digitised.
This is where we need your help.
With modern tools we can now reconstruct the weather patterns over Europe but there are many gaps which these observations will help fill.
We will be able to better examine particular storms and unusual weather events. As the world warms we expect the frequency of some types of extreme weather to change and this data will provide a baseline to help us measure those changes.

As a university-based research collection and public museum of natural history, the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University is all about the acquisition and dissemination of knowledge about plants. Central to the pursuit of this mission is the development and stewardship of a living collection of temperate trees, shrubs, and vines--numbering some 15,000 accessioned plants and regarded as one of the most diverse and well-documented collections of its kind on Earth.
A Repository of Knowledge
Documentation of the living collections includes thousands of historic and contemporary photographs of these plants in whole and in detail, captured through the seasons and often highlighting specific life cycle events (phenology). Annotating these images to define their content represents an essential step in creating a searchable, user-friendly interface to share these images with the public.
A Public Resource
Once annotated with descriptive tags and shared on the Arboretum’s website, these photographs will be used in diverse ways among multiple audiences—from helping children to learn the basic parts of a plant, providing high quality images of plants for K-12 and university teachers, and assisting graduate researchers studying climate change. Students of horticulture and amateur gardeners alike will hone their plant identification skills through simple queries. Arboretum staff and visiting scholars will have access to tagged images for research projects and to verify accession data. Ultimately, this curated database of images will support the Arboretum’s efforts to correct “plant blindness”—the human tendency to relegate the photosynthetic world to the background of our lives."

247;Zen of Dragons;finished;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/willkuhn/zen-of-dragons/about/research;"A Little About Odonata
Dragonflies and damselflies are some of the coolest beasts you'll ever meet! You are probably most familiar with dragonflies, the often-colorful, aerial acrobats that inhabit ponds, lakes and streams, but there's a second ""flavor"" of dragonfly that you might not be familiar with: the damselfly. Damselflies are typically (but not always) smaller than dragonflies, they're usually less agile fliers and they look a bit daintier than their robust cousins. Together, dragonflies and damselflies make up the insect order Odonata, and we collectively call them ""odonates"" or just ""odes"".
When you encounter an odonate perched on pond-side twig or soaring over a grassy field, you're looking at the terrestrial adult stage of a mostly aquatic organism. Like most insects, Odonata undergo metamorphosis, starting out as an egg, going through several stages as an aquatic nymph, and finally emerging as an adult. Odonates spend most of their lives in the water as alien-like nymphs, and (depending on the species) this stage may last 5 or more years! Both odonate nymphs and adults are voracious predators. Nymphs can eat other insect larvae, worms, tadpoles, and small fish. Adults eat pretty much any flying thing that they can catch, including flies, butterflies, beetles, bees, other odonates, and occasionally even hummingbirds!
Their relatively large size, striking features, and delightful behaviors make odonates a second love for many bird-watchers. Indeed, there are national and international organizations devoted to the appreciation and conservation of these creatures. Odonata also makes an excellent model for a wide range of scientific research. Their dependence on clean, freshwater habitats, makes odonates useful biological indicators of the quality of these ecosystems (think of them as freshwater canaries!). Odonata was one of the earliest groups of insects and among the first animals to take flight, so they give scientists a window into prehistoric life. Their flight style is unusual among insects and studying it helps us to understand the mechanics of flight on a small scale (e.g. for developing unmanned aerial vehicles). Understanding how they are able to track and react to prey with lightning-fast speed may help engineers to develop the next generation of robotic technology. In addition, many species of dragonflies and damselflies exhibit complex sexual selection and mating behaviors, helping us understand the role that sexual selection has played on the evolution of these insects.
In North America, there are 464 different species of dragonflies and damselflies. A number of field guides have been published in the past decade to help enthusiasts to identify these species. Unfortunately, there are some odonates that are still pretty difficult to distinguish from one another if you are unfamiliar with this group, even with the help of one of these guides. We hope to make odonate identification quick and easy for anyone, regardless of their level of expertise.
The Project
The purpose of this research is to develop software, called Odomatic, to automatically identify dragonfly and damselfly adults from images. This system could be incorporated into a website, like OdonataCentral, or power identification in a smartphone app, like Dragonfly ID. Image-based species identification systems are based on computer vision algorithms and machine learning models--computer programs that analyze digital images to find objects of interest (like dragonflies) and then learn to classify those objects. These models need to be trained using lots of images and we are currently working with over 80,000 images of odonate adults that have been submitted to OdonataCentral. Our system has two major parts: (1) a localization model for locating a dragonfly or damselfly in an image, and (2) a classification model for predicting that individual's species identity. With the Zen of Dragons project on Zooniverse, we are soliciting the help of citizen scientists like you to help us build a set of annotated training images for training the localization model--that is, a set of images where all the odonates have been manually located. Spotting odonates in images is a simple task for humans but challenging for computers. However, computer vision models are becoming better and better at tasks like these. For example, think of how good Facebook or Google are at finding friends' faces in your photographs!
You can help by participating in the Zen of Dragons project. By simply drawing boxes around dragonflies and damselflies in photographs, you'll help to train a computer to recognize odonates, you'll be contributing to scientific research, and you'll get to see some beautiful insects along the way!

248;Count flowers for bees;finished;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/eileenfranklin/count-flowers-for-bees/about/research;"Why count flowers?
Flowers contain nectar and pollen which is food for pollinators like bees, butterflies and hoverflies. In order to conserve pollinators, we need to figure out where they can get their food. Therefore, we are gathering information about the abundance and distribution of flowers in Ireland. We have hundreds of photos which were taken in wild places all over Ireland. We want to identify and count the flowers in these photos, but that’s a lot of work, so we need your help!
What are pollinators and why are they important?
Pollinators help many plants produce seeds and fruits by carrying pollen from one flower to another flower (of the same plant species) while they feed. The majority of wild plants and 75% of crops used directly for our food benefit from pollination by bees and other animals. In fact, insect pollination has been estimated to be worth €153 billion per year globally! In Ireland, bees are worth at least €54 million per year. Therefore, we are really dependent on pollinators because they provide us with food and ensure that the ecosystems we live in are healthy and robust.
What problems do pollinators face?
Pollinators are declining at an alarming rate in different areas of the world. Wild pollinators have been badly affected by agricultural intensification and habitat loss in Europe and North America. This means that pollinators are left with less flowers to feed on and no places to nest in. Disease and poisoning from pesticides are also major problems for pollinators. In Ireland, 30% of the 97 wild bee species are threatened with extinction, 50% decreased in numbers and 3 have gone extinct already. Other countries in Europe and North America have seen similar declines. Domesticated honeybees have also declined by 59% in the USA and 25% in Europe.
What will we do with this flower information?
With all this flower information we will make a flower map. This flower map will help us figure out where in Ireland is good or bad for pollinators. In turn, we will be able to see in which areas of the country pollinators need our help. This map will also help us make more informed decisions about how we use our land, now and in the future.

Our team headed into the Central Africa Rainforest of Gabon to set up a network of hidden cameras that use motion sensors to take photos when an animal passes in front of them. These cameras are really useful for studying elusive animals like the Forest Elephant as these animals are often scared of people.
Our cameras are set up in Gabon, we'd love to show you exactly which forests they're in, but to protect the location of the elephants from poachers we have to keep their (and the elephant's!) location a secret.
The cameras stay up in the forest, and every few weeks our team returns to copy the photographs so we can start analysing them... and that's where you come in!
We need help to go through all the photos and decide which photos have elephants in them (or gorillas or leopards!) and how many elephants you can see. This helps us work out where the elephants are living and how big their family groups are.
The photo analysis is straightforward: Look through the photos and mark them as either having an elephant in them or not, and if they do have an elephant in them how many elephants can you see. Quick and easy, plus it's exciting to hunt through photos and find these rare and elusive creatures. You'll often run into other rainforest animals to identify as well, leopards, gorillas, chimpanzees, red river hogs, and buffalo are common in these forests!

It is a tide that never recedes. Day by day, year on year it grows. Estimates are currently at trillions of
pieces and counting, with over 60% of the oceans being heavily contaminated with plastics. With each
piece of plastic taking over 400 years to degrade, our oceans, all marine life, and even our own health
and livelihoods are in real danger of drowning.
Despite this and the 8 million tonnes of Plastics entering our ocean each year, researches can only account for where 1% of that it ends up; our ocean surface. That begs the question where is the missing 99%?
Here is where The Plastic Tide comes in,
The answer can be found on the seafloor, in marine life, and on our coastlines. The Plastic Tide harnesses drone imagery from a series of beaches and the power of computer programs, or Machine Learning Algorithms for the more technically minded, to eventually create a program that can autodetect, measure and monitor the levels of Plastics and Marine Litter washing up on our beaches. Eventually helping us to track where plastics and litter go in our oceans, revealing where the missing 99% is in our ocean goes.
This is where YOU come in,
By tagging plastics and litter in the images we take with our drone, you are directly teaching our computer program to autodetect, measure and monitor plastics to help researchers answer how much of the Missing 99% ends up on our beaches. The more you tag, the better the computer program gets at identifying plastics!
We'll also make all the images we take using drones, your hard work tagging and our computer program available freely online for anyone to use. This will allow others to monitor their own beaches, whilst generating scientifically valuable datasets for local and global researchers, helping us understand this global issue.

Astronomy is a challenging science, because astronomers can only observe the Universe - never able to visit, or experiment with our subjects. So astronomers want to collect as much information from the objects we study as possible. By splitting the light we observe into spectra we can work out the ages and make-up of the stars and gas, and even make maps of the motions of those components.
The below image shows and example of some of the maps we can make for a galaxy observed with MaNGA. From left to right is shown the motions of the stars (the ""stellar velocity field"") where red is moving away, blue towards us; the Hα emission line map (this reveals where new stars are forming); and finally the motions of this Hα gas.

MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory) is a survey conducted as part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), which aims to make spectral maps of around 10,000 galaxies. It is doing this using Integral Field Units (IFUs), which are able to measure the spectra at many points across the galaxy. As well as using these data to find out what atoms are present from their spectral fingerprints, which reveals the ages and make-up of the stars and gas in the galaxy, we can use the spectra to determine whether the body that emitted the light is moving towards or away from us. This allows us to build up maps of the various motions of the stars and gas within the galaxy.
This image shows one of the seventeen IFU bundles used by MaNGA for each of its observations - MaNGA observes seventeen galaxies at once! On the left is shown an image of the face of a 127 fibre IFU. Its ferrule housing which holds the IFU and allows it to be plugged into the SDSS plate is shown on the right.

Once we have these maps, we want to compare them with the features of the galaxy that are present in the visible light image, like spiral arms, galactic bars, bulges, nuclei and more. This is where you come in! By completing the tasks on this project, you will be providing us with the locations of the various morphological features present in the galaxies, enabling us to map them onto the spectral data, and thus determine how the morphological features interact with the ages, chemical make-up and kinematics of the stars and gas in the galaxy.
Putting all this together will help us to improve our understanding of how and why galaxies' appearances change over time."

Citizen scientists, why does your work on Notes from Nature matter for both science and museums globally?
Natural history museums across the world share a common goal – to conserve and make available knowledge about natural and cultural heritage. The Notes from Nature project gives you the opportunity to make a scientifically important contribution towards that goal. Every transcription that is completed brings us closer to filling gaps in our knowledge of global biodiversity and natural heritage.
The challenge of making natural history data available for the broadest use is enormous. Today, there are ~10 billion specimens housed in natural history museums around the world! These biological collections document where species and populations exist now and where they existed decades and centuries before, so they hold irreplaceable information necessary for uncovering the patterns of changes in species distributions and ecosystem composition over time. Scientists and other stake holders use such data and information in order to address key environmental issues we are facing right now, such as how biodiversity loss can impact human well-being, prosperity and health.
While we want to eventually digitize all this information, the best way to do it is focused on scientific value and outcomes, and we have therefore organized this effort into “expeditions” that you can join, and in the process meet and help museum staff and biodiversity scientists working on different parts of this bigger puzzle. Learn more about the NFN team, and the scientists and curators providing expeditions here.

Hurricane Dorian is a strong tropical cyclone currently affecting the Bahamas and the Southeastern United States. It is the fourth named storm, second hurricane, and first major hurricane of the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season. The system gradually intensified while moving toward the Lesser Antilles, before becoming a hurricane on August 28. Rapid intensification ensued, and on August 31, Dorian intensified into a Category 4 major hurricane. On the following day, Dorian reached Category 5 intensity, peaking with one-minute sustained winds of 185 mph (295 km/h) while making landfall in Elbow Cay, Bahamas. Dorian made another landfall on Grand Bahama several hours later, near the same intensity.
This project aims to rapidly assess pre- and post-event satellite imagery, in order to produce a heat map of urgent priorities for teams involved in early recovery efforts.

Hawk Talk is a new project of the Bird Cams Lab from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, funded by the National Science Foundation. Even though Red-tailed Hawks are one of the most widespread North American birds, scientists still have so much to discover about their behavior and vocalizations.
Hawk Talk is also a research investigation that is co-created by cam viewers and scientists. During the summer of 2018, a group of volunteer cam watchers spent weeks observing the Red-tailed Hawk cam, brainstorming questions about what they were seeing, and ultimately voting on a question to investigate:
Do hawks use different kinds of calls in different situations at the nest?
Previous researchers that have documented Red-tailed vocalizations have been mostly limited to what they can hear on the ground or when briefly checking a nest. The 24/7 Red-tailed Hawk cam gives us the chance to document vocalizations right at the nest for the entire season without disturbing the birds!

261;Where are my body organs?;finished;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/h-spiers/where-are-my-body-organs/about/research;"Why are we doing this research?
When the general population have to attend a GP appointment, Accident & Emergency, or any other healthcare visit they often describe pain or discomfort in a specific area, for instance stomach pain may be listed anywhere in the abdomen. The healthcare professional who diagnoses and treats you has studied anatomy and will know the structure(s) that are affected.
However, some members of the public know a large amount of anatomy. An example would be someone who spends time in a gym, might have familiarity with, for examples some muscles. This research intends to highlight exactly how much the general public know about their own body and thus utilise it, via publication as a research article(s), to illustrate the need for sound anatomical knowledge from medical professionals and to help everyone understand where many of the common organs and structures are in the body.
We also aim to highlight how anatomical knowledge is different across different groups of people, i.e is there a difference between males and females? If you have been to a visit a healthcare professional recently do you perform better, because you are more aware of structures? Does the knowledge of people change as they age?
We have undertaken preliminary research on this topic, which can be found [here]: (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ase.1746/abstract)
What our research goals?
We are aiming to undertake the largest project to date to understand the anatomical knowledge of the general public, we have a number of specific questions that we are looking to answer:
What is the extent of anatomical knowledge of the global population?
Are there any observable differences between the ages and gender of the respondents?
Will individuals that work in a health care facility/profession perform well?
Will individuals that recently (within a week) went for a consultation with a healthcare professional perform well?
Is there geographic/regional differences in performances?
Overall, we hope that our research will demonstrate that there is a varied level of knowledge within the public and that there are certain areas of anatomy that we can do more to educate everyone about in the hope that we will improve how people interact with healthcare services, to improve the outcome for all involved.

262;Galaxy Builder;finished;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/tingard/galaxy-builder/about/research;"Galaxy Builder
Galaxies are complicated. We need your help to build models of them.
This project lets you create a model of a galaxy image, which we can use learn about its structure, and how it assembled over cosmic time.
More than the sum of its parts
Galaxies can be broken down into multiple components. Most galaxies can be built with a bulge (a kiwi fruit-shaped bit) and a disc (shaped like a dinner plate). Many also have bars and spiral arms. Being able to separate the light from these different components will allow us to study the star formation history of each separately, as well as helping us understand the galaxy's dynamical history (such as any galaxy mergers it has been through).
For example, the presence of a ""classical"" bulge (one that's very centrally concentrated, and likely does not rotate) in a galaxy suggests that it has undergone some kind of merger event, with the brightness of the bulge relative to the galaxy disc tied to the strength of the merger.
How do researchers analyse galaxy structure?
Previous Galaxy Zoo projects have produced a wealth of new science, but most have been limited to simple multiple-choice questions. To obtain precise mathematical descriptions of galaxy structure scientists make use of computer fitting algorithms to automatically find the best model for a given galaxy.
The problem with computational fitting is that when galaxies become complicated the computer struggles to find the best model, as it is generally just trying to maximise some goodness-of-fit statistic. This results in scientists having to check the results and often control things manually, which isn't scalable with the size of modern surveys. A recent study by Gao and Ho found that just performing a detailed structural analysis of only 10 galaxies was unfeasibly time-consuming using current tools. The 10 galaxies they looked at can be seen here:

Caption: Gao & Ho (2017), Figure 1
  One of the take-home messages from their paper was that it is important to properly model secondary (complicated) components, and future morphological analyses should attempt to take them into account.
This is where the strength of citizen science comes in: by letting you build models by hand you can come to decisions using previous experience and physical intuition about how the galaxy should be modelled, and by combining your answers with computer fits we'll be able to get much better results than either humans or a computer alone!

Seagrasses are the only group of true marine flowering plants, generally found in shallow sheltered tropical and temperate waters around the world. They create complex habitats in otherwise featureless, muddy and sandy seabeds, providing homes for a rich variety of species. Here in the UK, many seagrass beds can be found in sheltered bays, estuaries and rias. Seagrass beds have a root system under the sediment (rhizomes) and long slender leaves above, which create a ‘canopy’. The rhizome grows in length and sends up new shoots which are genetic clones of the original. Seagrass also reproduces sexually and creates pollen just like grasses on land.
Seagrass beds provide many benefits to people living in coastal communities - we call these ecosystem services. This important habitat has been recognised for its role in the life cycles of many commercial fisheries species, acting as a nursery ground for juveniles. It can also help sub tidal coastal areas by stabilising sediments, reducing coastal erosion, and improving water quality. More recently it has been recognised as being 40 times more effective at storing carbon than rainforest, helping reduce effects of global warming. It also releases large amounts of oxygen into the surrounding seas improving water quality for other species.
THREATS TO THIS VITAL HABITAT
Due to coastal development and physical pressures, this fragile habitat faces many threats around the world including:
Poor water quality - pollutants and excess nutrients which cause algal blooms
Invasive species from abroad- competing for light and space
Disease
Increased recreational water use over the habitat
Lack of local knowledge about its location and importance
In 2014, it was found that seagrass is one of the most rapidly declining ecosystems on Earth- with 7% of its known area disappearing every year (source: 11th International Seagrass Biology Workshop, 2014). In the UK, seagrass beds have been identified as threatened nationally and in need of conservation so have therefore been classed as a Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) habitat. Many of the seagrass beds we will survey throughout this project also have other conservation designations such as Marine Conservation Zone, Special Area of Conservation and Site of Special Scientific Interest. All of which are designed to stop the degradation of these important habitats and the animals that live there. This priority habitat is home to many rare, exciting and protected species such as both species of UK seahorse, fan mussels and stalked jellyfish.
However, despite awareness of the importance of these habitats they are in decline globaly; more work is needs to protect and preserve them. This is where the Community Seagrass Initiative aims to help.
HOW YOU CAN HELP
Check Out Commercial Fish Species
As part of our surveying strategy we deploy a baited underwater camera to try and attract and capture photos of mobile animals that live within the seagrass beds. The camera captures time lapse photos and these are what we need your help to analyse as part of the Zooniverse Seagrass Explorer. Seagrass is known for its vital role in the life cycles of many commercially important fisheries species and the results we gain from the Seagrass Explorer will allow us to find out which species are present where and estimate abundance of these different animals.
Dive Into Seagrass Density
You can also help us to monitor the density of seagrass in the meadows growing across the project area. This will give us an understanding of how healthy they are and how they change seasonally and over longer time scales. In this workflow we'd also like you to look out for any seaweed (algae) and animals present. Algae is very fast growing and can compete with seagrass plants for light and space. Learning more about whether algae and other animals are present and how commonly they are seen will show us if there is any relationship between seagrass health and the animals and algae that are present there.
ABOUT THE PROJECT
The Community Seagrass Initiative (CSI) is a citizen science project led by the National Marine Aquarium and contributing partners, and kindly funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund. The project will involve participants in citizen science - volunteers will gather information, subsequently contributing a greater scientific understanding of the heritage.
The CSI will cover 19 subtidal seagrass beds in five regions along the 191 mile stretch of coastline from Looe in Cornwall to Ringstead, just East of Weymouth in Dorset. Surveying activities will be based around 5 centres: Looe (1 seagrass bed), Plymouth (7 seagrass beds), Salcombe (1 seagrass bed), Torbay (5 seagrass beds) and Weymouth (5 seagrass beds).
Project Goals
Engagement - Increase knowledge, influence attitudes and modify behaviours of a varied audience on the importance of seagrass communities and the individuals role in the protection of this vital element of our natural heritage.
Action - Establish a long term, volunteer led monitoring programme for seagrass habitats and Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) species across 19 seagrass locations in the South West, UK.
Conservation - Produce an evidence base to support future investment into new, practical conservation tools, to monitor the health of seagrass communities and protect them from human impacts.
CSI Team and Project Partners
The CSI project officers, who co-ordinate all aspects of the project, are: Project Manager Mark Parry based at the National Marine Aquarium in Plymouth, Rachel Cole based at Torbay Coast and Countryside Trust in Torbay and Jess Mead based at Weymouth SEALIFE Adventure Park.
Through the development process the CSI has received strong support from other conservation and scientific organisations, partners that will assist in the delivery of the CSI are:
National Marine Aquarium
Torbay Coast and Countryside Trust
Living Coasts
Weymouth SEALIFE Adventure Park
The project is also supported by, University of Plymouth Marine Institute, the Marine Biological Association, South Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Tamar Estuary Consultative Forum, Devon Wildlife Trust, Cornwall Wildlife Trust, Dorset Wildlife Trust, British and Irish Associations of Zoos and Aquaria, Marine Conservation Society - Seasearch and Looe Voluntary Marine Conservation Group.

Every day since 1860 the UK Met Office has produced daily weather reports from across western Europe. The observations came from Sweden in the north to Spain in the south, and from Ireland in the west to Germany in the east.
Originally the weather observations were transmitted by telegraph to London and collated. Most of the weather observations, especially from before 1950, have never been digitised.
This is where we need your help.
With modern tools we can now reconstruct the weather patterns over Europe but there are many gaps which these observations will help fill.
We will be able to better examine particular storms and unusual weather events. As the world warms we expect the frequency of some types of extreme weather to change and this data will provide a baseline to help us measure those changes.

As a university-based research collection and public museum of natural history, the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University is all about the acquisition and dissemination of knowledge about plants. Central to the pursuit of this mission is the development and stewardship of a living collection of temperate trees, shrubs, and vines--numbering some 15,000 accessioned plants and regarded as one of the most diverse and well-documented collections of its kind on Earth.
A Repository of Knowledge
Documentation of the living collections includes thousands of historic and contemporary photographs of these plants in whole and in detail, captured through the seasons and often highlighting specific life cycle events (phenology). Annotating these images to define their content represents an essential step in creating a searchable, user-friendly interface to share these images with the public.
A Public Resource
Once annotated with descriptive tags and shared on the Arboretum’s website, these photographs will be used in diverse ways among multiple audiences—from helping children to learn the basic parts of a plant, providing high quality images of plants for K-12 and university teachers, and assisting graduate researchers studying climate change. Students of horticulture and amateur gardeners alike will hone their plant identification skills through simple queries. Arboretum staff and visiting scholars will have access to tagged images for research projects and to verify accession data. Ultimately, this curated database of images will support the Arboretum’s efforts to correct “plant blindness”—the human tendency to relegate the photosynthetic world to the background of our lives."

267;Zen of Dragons;finished;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/willkuhn/zen-of-dragons/about/research;"A Little About Odonata
Dragonflies and damselflies are some of the coolest beasts you'll ever meet! You are probably most familiar with dragonflies, the often-colorful, aerial acrobats that inhabit ponds, lakes and streams, but there's a second ""flavor"" of dragonfly that you might not be familiar with: the damselfly. Damselflies are typically (but not always) smaller than dragonflies, they're usually less agile fliers and they look a bit daintier than their robust cousins. Together, dragonflies and damselflies make up the insect order Odonata, and we collectively call them ""odonates"" or just ""odes"".
When you encounter an odonate perched on pond-side twig or soaring over a grassy field, you're looking at the terrestrial adult stage of a mostly aquatic organism. Like most insects, Odonata undergo metamorphosis, starting out as an egg, going through several stages as an aquatic nymph, and finally emerging as an adult. Odonates spend most of their lives in the water as alien-like nymphs, and (depending on the species) this stage may last 5 or more years! Both odonate nymphs and adults are voracious predators. Nymphs can eat other insect larvae, worms, tadpoles, and small fish. Adults eat pretty much any flying thing that they can catch, including flies, butterflies, beetles, bees, other odonates, and occasionally even hummingbirds!
Their relatively large size, striking features, and delightful behaviors make odonates a second love for many bird-watchers. Indeed, there are national and international organizations devoted to the appreciation and conservation of these creatures. Odonata also makes an excellent model for a wide range of scientific research. Their dependence on clean, freshwater habitats, makes odonates useful biological indicators of the quality of these ecosystems (think of them as freshwater canaries!). Odonata was one of the earliest groups of insects and among the first animals to take flight, so they give scientists a window into prehistoric life. Their flight style is unusual among insects and studying it helps us to understand the mechanics of flight on a small scale (e.g. for developing unmanned aerial vehicles). Understanding how they are able to track and react to prey with lightning-fast speed may help engineers to develop the next generation of robotic technology. In addition, many species of dragonflies and damselflies exhibit complex sexual selection and mating behaviors, helping us understand the role that sexual selection has played on the evolution of these insects.
In North America, there are 464 different species of dragonflies and damselflies. A number of field guides have been published in the past decade to help enthusiasts to identify these species. Unfortunately, there are some odonates that are still pretty difficult to distinguish from one another if you are unfamiliar with this group, even with the help of one of these guides. We hope to make odonate identification quick and easy for anyone, regardless of their level of expertise.
The Project
The purpose of this research is to develop software, called Odomatic, to automatically identify dragonfly and damselfly adults from images. This system could be incorporated into a website, like OdonataCentral, or power identification in a smartphone app, like Dragonfly ID. Image-based species identification systems are based on computer vision algorithms and machine learning models--computer programs that analyze digital images to find objects of interest (like dragonflies) and then learn to classify those objects. These models need to be trained using lots of images and we are currently working with over 80,000 images of odonate adults that have been submitted to OdonataCentral. Our system has two major parts: (1) a localization model for locating a dragonfly or damselfly in an image, and (2) a classification model for predicting that individual's species identity. With the Zen of Dragons project on Zooniverse, we are soliciting the help of citizen scientists like you to help us build a set of annotated training images for training the localization model--that is, a set of images where all the odonates have been manually located. Spotting odonates in images is a simple task for humans but challenging for computers. However, computer vision models are becoming better and better at tasks like these. For example, think of how good Facebook or Google are at finding friends' faces in your photographs!
You can help by participating in the Zen of Dragons project. By simply drawing boxes around dragonflies and damselflies in photographs, you'll help to train a computer to recognize odonates, you'll be contributing to scientific research, and you'll get to see some beautiful insects along the way!

268;Count flowers for bees;finished;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/eileenfranklin/count-flowers-for-bees/about/research;"Why count flowers?
Flowers contain nectar and pollen which is food for pollinators like bees, butterflies and hoverflies. In order to conserve pollinators, we need to figure out where they can get their food. Therefore, we are gathering information about the abundance and distribution of flowers in Ireland. We have hundreds of photos which were taken in wild places all over Ireland. We want to identify and count the flowers in these photos, but that’s a lot of work, so we need your help!
What are pollinators and why are they important?
Pollinators help many plants produce seeds and fruits by carrying pollen from one flower to another flower (of the same plant species) while they feed. The majority of wild plants and 75% of crops used directly for our food benefit from pollination by bees and other animals. In fact, insect pollination has been estimated to be worth €153 billion per year globally! In Ireland, bees are worth at least €54 million per year. Therefore, we are really dependent on pollinators because they provide us with food and ensure that the ecosystems we live in are healthy and robust.
What problems do pollinators face?
Pollinators are declining at an alarming rate in different areas of the world. Wild pollinators have been badly affected by agricultural intensification and habitat loss in Europe and North America. This means that pollinators are left with less flowers to feed on and no places to nest in. Disease and poisoning from pesticides are also major problems for pollinators. In Ireland, 30% of the 97 wild bee species are threatened with extinction, 50% decreased in numbers and 3 have gone extinct already. Other countries in Europe and North America have seen similar declines. Domesticated honeybees have also declined by 59% in the USA and 25% in Europe.
What will we do with this flower information?
With all this flower information we will make a flower map. This flower map will help us figure out where in Ireland is good or bad for pollinators. In turn, we will be able to see in which areas of the country pollinators need our help. This map will also help us make more informed decisions about how we use our land, now and in the future.
Count Flowers for Bees is part of the FLOMAP project which is funded by the Irish Research Council – Government of Ireland Postdoctoral Fellowship Scheme 2014. The photos are property of the Irish National Parks and Wildlife Service."
269;Computer Vision: Serengeti;finished;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/alexbfree/computer-vision-serengeti/about/research;"Background on Automating Animal Detection
Recently, a focus area for many researchers, engineers and computer scientists has been to try and develop automatic algorithms to efficiently process huge amounts of nature-related audiovisual footage.
The emerging and highly interdisciplinary fi eld of Animal Biometrics aims to develop and apply approaches that can automatically detect, represent, and interpret phenotypic appearance of various animal species. Such algorithms can be used to detect animals in images and video files, recognise particular behaviours, classify diff erent species, count animals or even identify individuals.
Many biologically-motivated research areas, such as ecology, behavioural research, or estimation of population sizes would benefit from automatic methods for non-invasive animal monitoring.
Due to its complexity, the field of Animal Biometrics requires the close interaction of many scientific disciplines. While biologists have detailed knowledge about the visual cues that let humans differentiate between different animal species, sub-species or individuals, computer scientists need this biological expertise in order to implement applicable computer-vision algorithms.
A very active research topic within the image processing and computer-vision community is the detection of various objects in visual footage. In contrast to image retrieval, object detection aims at determining the locations and sizes of specific objects within an image or video. The automatic detection of animals is particularly challenging due to the deformable nature of animal bodies.
A vast number of computer vision algorithms for object detection have been developed during the past 20 years ranging from simple Template Matching approaches to more advanced Rigid Object Detectors (which is now often implemented in consumer cameras for face detection). More recent approaches include Deformable Object Detectors as well as approaches based on Neural Networks and Deep Learning.
How does this project help?
All of these methods have one thing in common: A lot of training data is required in order to learn what distinguishes a particular animal from the background and to evaluate the performance of any ""answer"" the algorithm produces. That training data needs to know not just that an image contains an animal; but which part of the image to focus on, and as much as possible about the animal's species, posture, direction and occlusion (whether it is obscured). Therefore, we need your help to mark at least 1,000 examples of each species. We will then use these images to train our algorithms, evaluate them, and benchmark them against each other.
As with all official Zooniverse projects, the outcomes of this research will be formally published. They will also be communicated on the MICO blog and on this website.
What does this mean for projects like Snapshot Serengeti?
We know that volunteers’ time is precious, and we want to ask you to classify only those images where your help is really needed.
Using computers to predict what is in an image, even if it's not 100% reliable, should enable us to reduce the number of classifications we will need for that image before we can be confident we have a confirmed species identification. This means we can complete our seasons faster, with less work required from volunteers, in order to get scientists results faster. It might also help us send you only the more interesting images.
Thank you for helping with this exciting project!"
270;Disk Detective;finished;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/ssilverberg/disk-detective/about/research;"Planets form from vast clouds of gas, dust, and chunks of rock---clouds in the shape of disks, with stars in the center. We can find out where planets are forming and where planets probably remain today by searching for stars that are surrounded by these disks. Finding these disks, called “debris disks” or “YSO disks” depending on their age and gas content, has been a major quest of astronomers for the last three decades.
NASA’s WISE mission observed more than two billion sources, including galaxies, stars, nebulae, and asteroids--not to mention image artifacts and noise. Among these two billion sources are thousands of new disks waiting to be discovered.
Here at Disk Detective, you will help astronomers find these disks, homes for extrasolar planets. You'll examine images of disk candidates from NASA's WISE mission, and compare them with images of from four different astronomical surveys: the SkyMapper Southern Sky Survey, the Pan-STARRS survey, the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), and the unWISE coadds of data from the WISE mission. Many of them will be junk, but every now and then you'll find a nice clean image, with no background objects or noise overwhelming the signal. And some of those will be new circumstellar disks!
This new version of the project is Disk Detective 2.0. It's a sequel to a citizen science project launched back in 2014 on the original Zooniverse Ouroboros platform. Disk Detective 1.0 discovered a whole new class of disks, called ""Peter Pan Disks"". Check out some more results from Disk Detective 1.0 here!
What are these ""disks"" we're trying to find?
A circumstellar disk is what it sounds like--it's a belt of material around a star. We typically expect debris disks to appear around main-sequence stars--stars that are in the main part of their life burning hydrogen. These are mostly made up of dust leftover from collisions of planetesimals--rocky bodies that might have eventually formed planets.
We also see disks around stars in their pre-main-sequence period--in the time when stars are actually forming. These disks are variously called Young Stellar Object (YSO) disks because they orbit pre-main sequence stars, or primordial disks because they are made up of material from the cloud that formed the star. These systems are very gas-rich. Some of these systems are known as protoplanetary disks, because they are the disks from which planets form!
To find these disks, we look for infrared excess--stars that have more infrared light than you would expect, which indicates the presence of material the gas and dust has warmed up. Here, we have selected a set of systems that have infrared excess--we are looking for your help to make sure that these systems actually look the way we expect them to (rather than looking like galaxies, or material from the gas and dust between stars).
Why use citizen science for this?
The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) surveyed the full sky in four wavelengths of infrared light, allowing it to discover tens of thousands of circumstellar disks...in and among the other billion sources it found. However, WISE images can confuse a disk-hosting star with a galaxy, or nebulosity between the stars. The most effective way to detect these differences is by visual inspection of objects in multiple wavelengths, including optical and near-infrared light. To evaluate multiple thousands of objects efficiently, we've asked citizen scientists like YOU to help us out!
What happens next?
Once you all decide that an object is a good candidate, the science team springs into action! With your helpful comments on Talk, we investigate the good candidates in astronomical catalogs to weed out certain kinds of false positive that don't show up in our classification data. Then we collect follow-up observations to learn more! The best candidates after this advanced vetting and follow-up become new disk candidates in published professional journal articles!
